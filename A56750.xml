            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I might give ſeveral Inſtances to ſhew this; but ſhall only mention one, wherein I have undertaken to defend our Church in its charge of Idolatry upon the Papiſts, in their <hi>Adoration</hi> of the <hi>Hoſt,</hi> which is in its Declaration about Kneeling at the Sacrament after the Office of the Communion, in which are theſe remarkable words, <hi>It is hereby declared, that no Adoration is intended, or ought to be done either unto the ſacramental Bread and Ware there bodily received, or unto any corporal preſence of Chriſts natural Fleſh and Blood; for the ſacramental Bread and Wine remain ſtill in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſubſtances, and therefore may not be adored, for that were Idolatry to be abhorred of all faithful Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</hi> Here it moſt plainly declares its mind againſt that, which is the Ground and Foundation of their Worſhipping the Hoſt, That the Elements do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in their natural Subſtances after Conſecration; if they do remain, as we and all Proteſtants hold, even the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> then in Worſhipping the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated Elements, they worſhip meer Creatures, and are by their own Confeſſion guilty of Idolatry, as I ſhall ſhow by and by; and if
<hi>Chriſt's natural Fleſh and Blood be not corporally preſent there,</hi> neither with the Subſtance, nor Signs of the Elements, then the Adoring what is there, muſt be the Adoring ſome things elſe than Chriſts body; and if Bread on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be there, and they adore that which is there, they muſt ſurely adore the Bread it ſelf, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our Church; but I ſhall afterwards ſtate the Controverſie more exactly between us. Our Church has here taken notice of the true Iſſue of it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that to be falſe, and that it is both Unfit and <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36224:4"/>Idolatrous too, to Worſhip the Elements upon any account after Conſecration, and it continued of the ſame mind, and expreſt it as particularly, and direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Canons of 1640, where it ſays<note n="a" place="margin">Canon 7. 1640. about placing the Communion Table under this head,

                  <p>It recommends at the ſame time, but with great Temper and Moderation, the religious Geſture of bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Altar, both before and out of the time of Celebration of the Holy Euchariſt, and in it, and in neither<note n="a" place="margin">Ib.

'Tis out of the great Honour and Reſpect that we bear to the Sacrament, that we are againſt the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it up and down as a ſhow, and the Expoſing and Proſtituting it to ſo ſhameful and Abuſe, and ſo groſs an Idolatry. We give very great Reſpect and Reverence to all things that relate to God, and are ſet apart to his Worſhip and Service; to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple where God is ſaid himſelf to dwell, and to be more immediately preſent; to the Altar whereon the Myſteries of Chriſts Body and Blood are ſolemnly celebrated; to the Holy Veſſels, that are always uſed in thoſe Adminiſtrations; to the Holy Bible, which is the Word of God, and the <hi>New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament</hi> of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as the Sacrament is his Body, and the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> in his Blood; to the Font, which is the Laver of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, wherein we put on Chriſt, as well as we eat him in the Euchariſt; and if we would ſtrain things, and pick out of the Ancient and Devout Chriſtians what is ſaid of all theſe, it would go as far, and look as like to adoring them, as what with all their care they collect and produce for adoring the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as I ſhall afterwards make appear, in Anſwer to what the<note n="a" place="margin">Jacob.

But we will not at all trouble our ſelves with thoſe parts of the Science of controverſie; nor ſhall we ſtand upon any of thoſe things. Well then, why may not Chriſt and his Body be adored in the Sacrament, if they are proper Objects of Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. No doubt but they may be adored in this <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> in the Sacrament of
<hi>Baptiſm</hi> too, and in all the Offices of the Chriſtian Religion, wherein we pray to Chriſt, and Kneel before him, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the devout acts of the mind toward him, put our truſt and hope in him, and expect Salvation from him, and devote our ſelves in all Subjection to him, and bow both our Souls and our Bodies, and give all, both internal and external Worſhip to him; this Adoration we give to Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever, and who ſits at the right hand of God the Father. And the very ſame the Papiſts give to the Sacrament, to the Hoſt, and the conſecrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the moſt Sovereign, and Abſolute, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Degree of Religious Worſhip that is due to God, whoſe creatures thoſe Elements are; or to Chriſt himſelf, who commanded us to receive them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him.

<hi>Bellarmine</hi> from this place; if <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36224:10"/>they make but one

G.</hi> ſaies, notwithſtanding his <hi>non eodem modo.</hi> If in the Incarnation of Chriſt, one ſhould ſay, That the Soul and Body of Chriſt are both united to his Divinity, but that both were not united after the ſame manner; but the Soul in ſuch a manner, as being a Spirit, and the Body in another; yet ſo, that both made but one <hi>Suppoſitum</hi> with it, and that Divine; and that all his humane Nature belong'd to that, and made one with that, tho not after the ſame manner; would not this be ſtill an owning the hypoſtatical Union between Chriſts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and his Soul and Body? and ſo muſt the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be between Chriſts Divinity, and his Body, and the Species; if they make one <hi>Suppoſitum,</hi> and are, as they hold, to be worſhipt as ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have taken care to give you their Doctrine, and ſtate the Caſe with ſome exactneſs; tho I am ſenſible, with too much length; but that is the way to ſhorten the Controverſie; and by this means I have cut off their common retreats, and ſtopt up thoſe little lurking holes they generally run to, and in which they are wont to Earth themſelves. As, that <pb n="15" facs="tcp:36224:10"/>they worſhip only Chriſt in the Sacrament, or Chriſt under the accidents of Bread and Wine; and that 'tis only Chriſt, or the Body of Chriſt with which his Divinity is always preſent, is the formal object of their Adoration in the Sacrament, and that their Worſhip is given to that, and not to the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Elements, or to the remaining Species of Bread and Wine; it appears from their own Doctrine and Principles to be quite otherwiſe; and if we take them at their own words, they are ſufficient to bear witneſs againſt them, and condemn them of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but this will be found to be much greater and groſſer, when the whole foundation of this Doctrine of theirs of the Worſhip of the Hoſt, proves upon Examination to be falſe, and one of the moſt thick and unreaſonable Errors in the World, to wit, the belief of Tranſubſtantiation, or that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, are converted into the natural and ſubſtantial Body and Blood of Chriſt, ſo that there remains nothing of the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine after Conſecration, but only the Fleſh and Blood of Chriſt corporally preſent, under the Species and Accidents of Bread and Wine. If this Doctrine be true, it will in great meaſure diſcharge them from the guilt of Idolatry; for then their only fault will be their joyning the Species, which how thin and ghoſtly ſoever they be, yet are Creatures, together with Chriſt, as one Object of Worſhip; and unleſs they alter their Doctrine on this point, from what it is now, I ſee not how they can juſtifie their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping with <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, or the Worſhip due only to God, not only the adorable ſubſtance of Chriſts Body, but the very Veils and Symbols under which they ſuppoſe that to lye; and yet when they teach, as they do, the adoring of the Sacrament, <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36224:11"/>they muſt adore the viſible and outward part of it, as well as the inviſible Body of Chriſt; for without the remaining Species, it would not, according to them, be a Sacrament; and they have not gone ſo far yet, I think, as to deny that there are any remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Species, and that our ſenſes do ſo far wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us, that when we ſee ſomething, there is really nothing of a viſible Object. And the ſame Object which is <hi>viſible,</hi> is
<hi>adorable</hi> too, according to them: If Chriſts Body were ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, tho it were lawful to adore it as there preſent; but by no means, either the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> or
<hi>Species</hi> of Bread <hi>with it;</hi> yet it is much to be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a duty, or neceſſary to do ſo. It would be preſent ſo like a Prince in <hi>Incognito,</hi> that he would ſeem not to require that Honour which we ought to give him under a more publick appearance.

But there are ſome more cautious and wary men amongſt them, who out of very juſt and reaſonable Fears <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36224:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Suſpicions, that Tranſubſtantion ſhould not prove true, and that they may happen to be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in that, have thought of another way, to cover and excuſe their Idolatry; and that is, not from the <hi>Truth,</hi> but meerly from the <hi>Belief</hi> of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. <hi>As long,</hi> ſay they, <hi>as we believe Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation to be true, and do really think that the Bread and Wine are converted into the ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood, and ſo Worſhip the Sacrament upon that account, tho we ſhould be miſtaken in this our belief; yet as long as we think that Chriſt is there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and deſign only to Worſhip him, and not the Bread, which we believe to be done away; this were enough to free us from the charge of Idolatry.</hi> To which, becauſe it is the greateſt, and the beſt Plea they have, and they that make it have ſome miſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, I doubt not, that Tranſuſtantiation will not hold; I ſhall therefore give a full Anſwer to it, in the following Particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All Idolatry does proceed from a miſtaken be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and a falſe ſuppoſal of the mind, which being groſs and unreaſonable, will not at all excuſe thoſe who are guilty of it; there were never any Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but might plead the excuſe of a miſtake, and that not much more culpable and notorious, one would think, than the miſtake of thoſe who think a bit of Bread, or a Wafer, is turn'd by a few words into a God. They all thought, however blindly and fooliſhly, that whatever it was they worſhipt, ought to be worſhipt upon ſome account or other; that it was a true and fit Object, and that Adoration right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong'd to it. Idolatry, tho it be a great Sin, and a great injury and affront to God, yet ariſes not ſo much from the malice of the will, as the blindneſs and darkneſs of the underſtanding; there were hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36224:13"/>ever any ſuch Idolaters as maliciouſly, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly intended to affront the true God, by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping falſe Gods or Creatures; as if a Subject ſhould paſs by his Prince out of ill will, and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to affront and defie him, and give the Reverence and Homage that was due to him, to a Rebel or fellow Subject ſtanding by him; but they did this, becauſe they miſtook the perſon, and thought this to be the Prince that was not, or that he was there where he was not, or that that which was there, ought to be worſhipt for his ſake; ſtill falſly ſuppoſing that they ought to worſhip that wrong Object, which they took to be right; or in that falſe manner which they took to be true; for if a miſtake will excuſe, it will excuſe in one as well as another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Tho they do not only think and believe that which they worſhip, to be a true Divine Object; but it really be ſo in it ſelf, and that which they have in their Thoughts and intentions to worſhip, be right; yet they may ſtill be guilty of Idolatry; for ſo were the
<hi>Jews</hi> in the Idolatry of the golden Calf, whereby they intended not to throw off the Worſhip of the true God, <hi>The God of Iſrael,</hi>

I would only ask, if a perſons having a right Object in his mind, in his thoughts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to adore, which <hi>T. G.</hi>

If not, then they may worſhip the unconſecrated Elements, as well as conſecrated, even whilſt they believe they are Bread; if it be, then having a right Object in our Thoughts, and Purpoſes, and Intentions, will not excuſe from Idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Whatever was the material Object of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worſhip, it was not worſhipt for it ſelf, no more than the Bread or its Accidents are by the Papiſts in the Euchariſt; but as they ſay of the Hoſt, becauſe they believed that the true Object of worſhip was really preſent in it, or in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary <pb n="22" facs="tcp:36224:14"/>manner united to it<note n="a" place="margin">Deos relictis ſedibus propriis non recuſare nec fugere, habitaculainire ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rena, quinimo jure dedicationis impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſos ſimulachrorum coaleſcere inunctioni, <hi>Arnob. contra gent. l.

<hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi> Conſult.</note>, <hi>of carrying about the Sacramental Bread in publick pomp, to be ſeen and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all eyes, is contrary to the mind and cuſtom of the Ancients, and ſeems to be lately brought in and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; for they had this myſtery in ſuch religious Veneration, that they would not admit any, not only to the partaking, but not to the ſight of it, but the Faithful, whom they accounted members of Chriſt, and worthy to partake of ſuch a Myſtery. Wherefore all thoſe who were but Catechumens, or were Energumeni or Penitents, and not Communicants, were always put out and diſmiſt at the Celebration of it.</hi> Whether they be Idolaters for adoring the Sacrament, I have conſidered already, and their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice joined with their Doctrine, makes it more evident. I ſhall now prove that this Adoration of theirs, <pb n="33" facs="tcp:36224:19"/>was neither commanded nor uſed by Chriſt, or the Apoſtles, nor by the Primitive Church, nor is truly meant and deſigned by any of thoſe Authorities of the Fathers, which they produce for it; and upon a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral view of the whole matter, That it is a very ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and ridiculous thing that tends moſt ſhamefully to reproach, and expoſe Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was not uſed or commanded by Chriſt or the Apoſtles, is plain from the account that all the Evangeliſts give us of Chriſts celebrating this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with his Apoſtles, where is only mention of their taking and eating the Bread, and drinking the Wine, after it was bleſſed by him, but not the leaſt tittle of their adoring it; ſo far from it, that they were not then in a poſture of Adoration, which they ſhould have been in, if they had inwardly adored it, which makes this not only a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Argument, as <hi>Boileau</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">
                        <hi>De Adorat. Euch.</hi> l. 2. c. 1.</note> would have it, but a poſitive one. To take off this argument from the no mention of any ſuch command or practice of Adoration to the Sacrament in the Goſpel; he ſays, Neither is the Adoration of Chriſt, preſcribed in expreſs words<note n="t" place="margin">Nullo exiis loco conceptis verbis praeſcriptam fuiſſe Adorationem, (ſc. Chriſti) <hi>p.</hi> 27.</note>, nor that of the Holy Ghoſt, either commanded or performed<note n="u" place="margin">Nullibi praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam ejus Adoratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem aut confeſtim peractam conceptis intelligamus, <hi>p.</hi>
98.</note>. But I hope all thoſe places of Scripture, that ſo fully tell us, that both Chriſt and the Holy Ghoſt are God, do ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand us to worſhip them, by bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding us worſhip God; and if it had told us that the Sacrament is as much God as they, it had then commanded us to adore it. There are ſufficient inſtances of Chriſts being adored, when he appeared upon Earth, and had the other Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <pb n="34" facs="tcp:36224:20"/>aſſumed a bodily Shape; thoſe who had ſeen and known it, would have particularly adored it, and ſo would the Apoſtles, no doubt, have done the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, if they had thought that, when it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, an object of worſhip. St.

<hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>One Bread, and one Body;</hi> yet they could not think this to be a God, or the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry natural Body of their Saviour, which they ſent thus commonly up and down, without that Pomp and Solemnity, that is now uſed in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and without which I own it is not fit a Deity ſhould be treated.

                  <p>So great an honour and regard had the Primitive Church for the Sacrament, that as they accounted it the higheſt Myſtery and Solemneſt part of their Worſhip, ſo they would not admit any of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, who had been guilty of any great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Sin, nor the Catechumens, nor the Poſſeſt, and Energumeni, ſo much as to the ſight of it; the

And therefore, as it is plainly contrary to the Primitive practice, to carry the Sacrament up and down, and expoſe it to the Eyes of all Perſons; ſo the reaſon of doing it, that it may be worſhipt by all, and that thoſe, who do not partake of it, may yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it; was, it is plain, never thought of in the primitive Church; for then they would have ſeen and worſhipped it, tho they had not thought fit that they ſhould have partaken of it. But he that will ſee how widely the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differs from the

                  <p>I ſhall now give an Anſwer to the Authorities which they produce out of the Fathers, and which Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> has, he tells us, been a whole year a gleaning out of them<note n="v" place="margin">Annuae vellicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onis litirariae ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinium reddo. <hi>Praef. ad Lect.</hi> Boileau

They are the only Argument he pretends to for this Adoration; and when Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all other Reaſons fail them, as they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do, then they fly to the Fathers; as thoſe who are ſenſible their forces are too weak to keep the open Field, fly to the Woods, or the Mountains, where they know but very few can follow them. I take it to be ſufficient, that in any neceſſary Article of Faith, or Eſſential part of Chriſtian Worſhip, (which this of the Sacrament muſt be, if it be any part at all,) it is ſufficient that we have the Scripture for us, or that the Scripture is ſilent, and ſpeaks of no more than what we own and admit. In other external and indifferent Matters relating meerly to the Circumſtances of Worſhip, the Church may for outward Order and Decency, appoint what the Scripture does not. But as to what we are to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and what we are to Worſhip the moſt poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Argument from any humane Authority is of no weight, where there is but a Negative from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But we have ſuch a due regard to Antiquity, and are ſo well aſſured of our cauſe, were it to <pb n="43" facs="tcp:36224:24"/>be tryed only by that, and not by Scripture, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> generally demurs to; that we ſhall not fear to allow them to bring all the Fathers they can for their Witneſſes in this matter, and we ſhall not in the leaſt decline their Teſtimony. <hi>Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau</hi> Muſters up a great many, ſome of which are wholly impertinent and inſigniſicant to the matter in hand, and none of them ſpeak home to the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs he brings them for. He was to prove, that they Taught that the Sacrament was to be adored, as it is in the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they only Teach as we do,
<hi>That it is to be had in great reverence</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as all other things relating to the Divine Worſhip; <hi>that it is to be received with great Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both of Body and Soul,</hi> and in ſuch a Poſture, as is to expreſs this, <hi>A Poſture of Adoration; that Chriſt is then to be worſhipped</hi> by us in this Office eſpecially, as well as he is in all other Offices of our Religion; <hi>that his Body, and his Fleſh,</hi> which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his Divinity, and which he offered up to his Father as a Sacrifice for all Mankind, and by which we are Redeemed, and which we do ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally partake of in the Sacrament, that this is to be adored by us; but not as being corporally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent there, or that the Sacrament is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipt with that, or for the ſake of that, or that which the Prieſt holds up in his Hands, or lyes upon the Altar, is to be the Object of our Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but only Chriſt and his bleſſed Body, which is in Heaven.</p>

But do ye not worſhip that which ye ſee, and which ye have before ye, and which is carried about? And would not any man that ſees what that is, think ye worſhip Bread or Wafer? And could you ever perſwade him, that it was any thing elſe? And if notwithſtanding what you think of it againſt all Senſe and Reaſon, it be ſtill Bread; then I hope it is Bread that ye worſhip; and till others think as wildly as ye do, ye muſt give them leave to think and charge ye thus. But if it were true, that ye did not worſhip the Bread, yet ye muſt and do own, that ye worſhip the Species of the Bread; and how ye ſhould do that, without being guilty of another very groſs Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, ye do not know your ſelves; for ye muſt make them ſo united to Chriſt, as to make one <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum,</hi> and ſo one Object of Worſhip, as his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity <pb n="61" facs="tcp:36224:33"/>and Godhead are; and then according to this way of yours, Chriſt may as well be ſaid to be Impanated and United to Bread, or its Species, as Incarnated and United to Fleſh, as ſome of you have taught<note n="w" place="margin">Bellarm. de Ruperto Abbate Tui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tienſi, <hi>l. 3.</hi> de Euch. <hi>c. 11.</hi>

For beſides the incredible wonder, that a bit of Bread ſhould by a few words of every common Prieſt, be turned immediately into the true and perfect Body of a man; nay, into ten thouſand Bodies at the ſame time, which is a greater Miracle than ever was done i'th' World, and is as great almoſt, as creating the World it ſelf out of nothing; and if it were true, would make the Prieſt a God, certainly, and not a man, and much rather to be worſhipt than a bit of Bread, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaies of the Heathen Idols,

<hi>It would otherwiſe derogate from the truth of this Sacrament and Chriſts preſence in it.</hi> So that wherever the Species are, there is always Chriſts Body, and whatever happens to them, happens to that alſo; If they fall to the ground, Chriſts Body does ſo to; and ſo, if they lie in a hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Tooth, or hang but in the leaſt <pb n="65" facs="tcp:36224:35"/>crum or drop upon a Communicants Beard; there according to their principles, they and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt be worſhipt with <hi>Latria;</hi> and if they be in a Mouſe or Flies body, that has got to them, the adorable Object ſtill goes with the Species, till they be corrupted; and whither the Species be corrupted, or no if they be poyſoned as they have ſomtimes been, or whether Chriſt be there with the Accidents of the Poyſon, I can't tell; but when the Species are in the pix, he is as faſt there, as he ever was in his Sepulcher, and to all appearance as dead and ſenſeleſs, and if the Species be Burnt or Gnawn, or vomited out of the Stomack, before they are corrupted, all theſe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes belong as truly to Chriſts Body as to them, and ſo worſe indignities may be thus offered every day to Chriſt glorious Body, than ever were offered to it, in its ſtate of Humility and Contempt upon Earth, when it was Spit upon, and Scourged, and Pierced, and Crucified by the <hi>Jews.</hi> But Good God! that men ſhould think to Honour and Adore Chriſt and his Body, by thus expoſing them to the danger of the vileſt Abuſes! that humane reaſon ſhould be ſo decayed and beſotted, as to believe and defend ſuch palpable Abſurdities! that Chriſtianity ſhould be ſo ſhamefully and abominably expoſed to all the World, by ſuch an extravagant Doctrine, and ſuch an obnoxious practice and unreaſonable Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as this is?

                  <head>AN ANSWER TO THE PREFACE of the Publiſher.</head>
                  <p>THe Tranſlatour of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Book of Communion under both Species, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving told us why he made choice of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom he ſtiles, <hi>The Treaſury of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the Fountain of Eloquence, the Oracle of his Age, and in brief, to ſpeak all in a word, the Great</hi> James, <hi>formerly Biſhop of</hi> Condom, <hi>now of</hi> Meaux: Having thus brought forth this great Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, he makes a plain Challenge with him to us of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>If this Author write Reaſon, he deſerves to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; if otherwiſe, he deſerves to be confuted:</hi> By this, I perceived he expected that we ſhould be ſo civil as to take notice of ſo great a Man as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> or any thing that bears his Name, and not let it paſs unregarded by us, after it was <hi>for our benefit,</hi> as he tells us, <hi>made Engliſh:</hi> and beſides, I did not know but ſome unwary perſons among us might <hi>believe the reaſon</hi> he writes however bad; and therefore I thought he deſerved to be confuted, and ought by no means to go without the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and complement of an
<hi>Engliſh Anſwer.</hi> This I doubt not might have been very well ſpared, had the Publiſher been pleaſed to have gone on a little further with his Work of Tranſlating, and obliged us, who are ſtrangers to the
<hi>French</hi> Tongue, with one of thoſe Anſwers which are made to <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Book in that Language, but ſince he has <pb facs="tcp:36224:39"/>not thought fit to do that, I must deſire him to accept of ſuch Entertainment as our Country will afford him, though it is ſomething hard, that we must not only treat our Friends at home, but have as many Strangers as they pleaſe put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us: But we who cannot Tranſlate ſo well as others, which is a much eaſier part than to Write at ones own charge, must beg leave of our
<hi>French</hi> Adverſaries, if we ſometimes ſpeak to them in plain
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> must excuſe me if Truth has ſometimes made me otherwiſe anſwer him, then if I were a
<hi>Curé</hi> in his own Dioceſs. Whoever has ſo great an opinion of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi>'s Vertue and Learning, as to take matter of Fact upon his word, which the Tranſlatour's mighty Commendations were deſigned, no doubt, to beget in his Reader, must believe the Communion in One Kind was the Practice of the Primitive and the Catholic Church, which if it were true, would be a very great, if not ſufficient excuſe for the <hi>Roman.</hi> This the Biſhop aſſerts with all the confidence in the World, and this his Book is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to make out; and whoever will not believe it, must neceſſarily queſtion either the <hi>Learning</hi> of this great Man, or elſe his <hi>Sincerity;</hi> I ſhall not dare to do the former, but his late <hi>Paſtoral Letter</hi> has given too much reaſon to ſuſpect the latter. He that can now tell the World, That there has been no Perſecution in
<hi>France,</hi> and that <hi>none has ſuffered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence either in their Perſons or their Eſtates</hi> there, for their Religion; may be allowed to ſay, That the Primitive Church had the Communion but in one Kind, a great while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go: But the one of theſe matters of Fact deſerves more, I think, to be confuted than the other.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it was for the ſake of the Author that the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlatour choſe this ſubject of Communion in One kind, though he ſays, <hi>It is a point peradventure of higher concern than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other now in debate between Papiſts and Proteſtants,</hi> this <hi>being the main Stone of Offence and Rock of Scandal, and it having been always regarded ſince the Reformation, as a mighty eye-ſore, and alledged as one ſufficient Cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:36224:39"/>of a voluntary departure and ſeparation from the Pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtent Church of</hi> Rome. When this <hi>Pre-exiſtent</hi> Church of <hi>Rome</hi> fell into her Corrupt, Terreſtrial, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian State, among other Corruptions, this was one that gave just offence, and was together with many more, the Cauſe of our ſeparating from it, That it gave the Eucharist but in one kind, contrary to Christ's Inſtitution, and took away the Cup of Christ's precious Bloud from the People: But yet <hi>this point of higheſt concern</hi> is, <hi>in the judgement</hi> of the Tranſlatour, <hi>but a bare Ceremony, and upon the whole matter the difference herein between the Church of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and the</hi> Roman, <hi>ſeems to him reducible in great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to meer Form and Ceremony.</hi> If it be, then I hope it may be eaſily compromized and agreed, for I aſſure him I am as little as he
<hi>for making wider Diviſions, already too great; nor do I approve of the Spirit of thoſe who tear Chriſt's ſeamleſs Garment</hi> for a meer Form and Ceremony; but we who are ſometimes thought fit to be called Heretics, and to be Cenſured and Anathematized as differing in Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential matters from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> at other times are made ſuch good Friends to it, that we differ but very little, and there is nothing but <hi>Form and Ceremony</hi> between us: But what is to Accomodate this matter, and Reconcile this difference between the two Churches? Why, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Real Preſence, in which, <hi>Both Churches,</hi> he ſays, <hi>agree, that Chriſt our Saviour is truly, really, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yea, and ſubſtantially preſent in the Sacrament.</hi> This is to cloſe up the difference not onely of Communion in one kind, but of the Adoration of the Sacrament, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Maſs too in the Tranſlatour's judgement: But does the Church of <hi>England</hi> then agree with the <hi>Roman</hi> in the Real Preſence of Christ's natural Body and Bloud in the Sacrament? Does it not expreſly ſay the contrary, namely, <hi>That the natural Body and Bloud of our Saviour Chriſt are in Heaven and not here,</hi> and that <hi>it is againſt the truth of Chriſt's natural Body to be at one time in more <pb facs="tcp:36224:40"/>places than one</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Rubric af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Office of Communion.</note>. So that though Christ be really pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent by his Spirit and the real Vertue and Efficacy of his Body and Bloud, be given in the Sacrament, yet his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body is by no means preſent there, either by Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation or <hi>by any other way unintelligible to us,</hi> as the Tranſlatour would inſinuate; ſo that all thoſe conſequences which he or others would willingly draw from the Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Christ's natural Body in the Sacrament, as belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by us, do fall to the ground; and I doubt he or I ſhall never be ſo happy as to make up this great breach between the two Churches, however willing we may be to do it; but inſtead of making a Reconciliation between them, which is impoſſible as long as the Doctrines of each of them ſtand as they do; I ſhall endeavour to defend that Article of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which not onely <hi>Modern Novelliſts,</hi> as the Tranſlatour calls thoſe who are not for his Real Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and his Reconciling way; but <hi>the moſt learned and ancient Proteſtants</hi> who have been either Biſhops, Prieſts, or Deacons in our Church, have owned and ſubſcribed, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-people, for both the parts of the Lord's Sacrament, by Chriſt's Ordinance and Commandment, ought to be miniſtred to all Chriſtian Men</hi>

                     </note> I ſuppoſe he means, that is, in difference between the Reformed and the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> it is indeed ſuch a Caſe as brings almoſt all other matters between us to an iſſue; namely to this Point, Whether the Church may give a <hi>Non obſtante</hi> to the Laws of Chriſt, and make other Laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his, by vertue of its own Power and Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? If it may in this caſe, it may in all others, and therefore it is the more conſiderable Queſtion, becauſe a great many others depend upon the Reſolution of it: When it had been thus determined in the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> yet a great many were ſo diſ-ſatisfied, namely, the
<hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mians</hi> to have the Cup taken from them, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of
<hi>Baſil</hi> was forced, upon their importunity, to grant it them again; and at the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> it was moſt earneſtly preſt by the
<hi>Germans</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> by the Embaſſadors of thoſe Nations, and by the Biſhops, that <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36224:41"/>the People might have the Cup reſtored to them. The truth in this cauſe, and the advantage ſeems to be ſo plain on the ſide of the Reformation, that as it required great Authority to bear it down, ſo it calls for the greateſt Art and Sophiſtry plauſibly to oppoſe it: One would think the caſe were ſo evident, that it were needleſs to ſay much for it, and impoſſible to ſay any thing conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable againſt it; but it is ſome mens excellency to ſhew their skill in a bad cauſe, and Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has choſen that Province, to make an experiment of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Wit and Learning, and to let us ſee how far thoſe will go to perplex and intangle the cleareſt Truth: He has mixt a great deal of boldneſs with thoſe as it was neceſſary for him, when he would pretend that Communion in one kind was the Practice of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, and that it was as effectual as in both, and that the Cup did not belong to the ſubſtance of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but was wholly indifferent to the Sacrament, and might be uſed or not uſed as the Church thought fit: How horribly falſe and erronious thoſe Pleas of his are, the following Diſcourſe will ſufficiently make out; and though he has ſaid as much, and with as much arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and ſubtilty as is poſſible in this cauſe, yet there being another Writer later then him<note n="†" place="margin">Boileau de praecepto divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no commun.

                     </note> who denys that there is any Divine Precept for Communion in both kinds, and who hath deſignedly undertaken the Scripture part of this Controverſie, which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has onely here and there cunningly interwoven in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe: I reſolve to conſider and examine it as it lies in both thoſe Authors; and though I have choſen my own method to handle it, which is, Firſt, from Scripture, then from Antiquity, and laſtly from the Reaſonings and Principles made uſe of by our Adverſaries; yet I ſhall all along have a particular regard to thoſe two great men, and keep my eye upon them in this Treatiſe, ſo as to paſs by nothing that is ſaid by either of them, that has <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36224:41"/>any ſtrength or ſhow in it; for my deſign is to
<hi>defend</hi> the Doctrine of our own Church in this matter, which our Adverſaries have thought fit to attaque, and to fall upon, not with their own, but the <hi>borrowed forces</hi> of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> whoſe great name and exploits are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where famous and renowned; but ſince we have all Chriſtian Churches in the World, except the
<hi>Roman,</hi> to be our ſeconds in this Cauſe, we ſhall not fear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them and our ſelves, and ſo plain a Truth againſt all the cunning and Sophiſtry of our Adverſaries, though it be never ſo artificially, and dreſt after the <hi>French</hi> Mode.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with Scripture, which ought to be our onely Rule, not onely in matters of Faith, which ſhould be founded upon nothing leſs than a Divine Revelation, but in matters of pure poſitive and arbitrary Inſtitution, as the Sacraments are; for they depend merely upon the will and pleaſure, the mind and intention of him that appointed them; and the beſt, and indeed the onely way to know that, is, by recurring to his own Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; as we know the mind of a Teſtator by going to his laſt Will and Teſtament, and by conſulting that, do beſt find how he has ordered thoſe things that were of his own free and arbitrary diſpoſal. And by this way we ſhall find, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by taking away the Cup, has plainly violated the Inſtitution of our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, and deprived the People of a conſiderable part of that Legacy which he bequeathed to them. Let us lay therefore before us the Inſtitution of our Saviour, as we find it in the three Evangeliſts, and in St. <hi>Paul</hi> as he <hi>received it of the Lord.</hi>

<hi>eat:</hi> And two of the Evangeliſts remark that particularly of the Cup, which they do not of the Bread, that they <hi>all</hi> drank of it, and that Chriſt ſaid expreſly to them, <hi>Drink ye all of it:</hi> As if the infinite Wiſdom of God which foreſaw all future events, and all the after-errours that ſhould ariſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Sacrament, had had ſome eſpecial regard to this very thing, and deſigned to prevent the abuſe and miſtake of thoſe who would not have all Chriſtians drink of this Cup, as well as eat of the Bread. What other reaſon there ſhould be of thoſe particular and remarkable words in St. <hi>Mathew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> relating to the Cup more than to the Bread; I believe it will be hard to find out, for Chriſt gave them the Bread juſt as he did the Cup, and there was no more danger that any of them at that time ſhould omit drinking the one, any more than eating the other; nor did there need any greater caution that we know of, or more particular command <pb n="5" facs="tcp:36224:42"/>in reference to themſelves for the one more than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet no doubt there was ſome great and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar reaſon for St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St.
<hi>Mark</hi>'s adding of thoſe words, of which there can be no ſuch probable account given, as their having a reſpect and relation to after Ages, as many other things in the Scripture have, which was written for the uſe, not onely of the preſent, but all times of the Church; and if theſe were ſpoken to the Apoſtles onely as Prieſts, as the <hi>Roman</hi> Sophiſters pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, though without any ground, as we ſhall ſhew by and by, there cannot then be given any reaſon for them <hi>as yet,</hi> for there is no ſuch corruption <hi>yet</hi> got into any part of the Chriſtian Church, as to forbid the <hi>Prieſts</hi> to drink of the Cup; and therefore it cannot be ſaid that this remark or precaution was upon their account, unleſs the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> will think fit to take it to themſelves, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the account of their not allowing their <hi>very Prieſts</hi> to Communicate of the Cup, unleſs when they Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Conſecrate; and ſo will have it regard onely that other abuſe of theirs which is unjuſtifiable, even up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own grounds, to wit, That the aſſiſtent Prieſts are not to receive it, though Chriſt by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion ſaid to the Prieſts who were preſent, <hi>Drink ye all of it:</hi> Which is the beſt way that I know, for them to come off of thoſe words by their own Principles. For to avoid the force of thoſe words, and to elude the plain Command and Inſtitution of our Saviour, about the Cup's being given to all Chriſtians, they ſay, The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles received it onely in the capacity of Prieſts; and that our Saviour's Command, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> belongs onely to Prieſts, and was given to the Apoſtles meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſuch; nay, Monſieur <hi>Boileau</hi> ſays,<note n="‖" place="margin">Igitur haec verba S.

                     <hi>de Meaux</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">P. 237.</note> that <hi>theſe words were addreſſed to the Apoſtles onely who were preſent, and had their entire accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment, when in effect they all drunk of it.</hi> Then it ſeems none but the Apoſtles themſelves, no other Prieſts have a right or a command to drink of the Cup, but onely the Apoſtles: And this they might ſay if they pleaſed, upon as good grounds, and defend with as much reaſon, as that the Apoſtles onely drank of it as Prieſts; but I ſuppoſe they do not intend to improve this notion ſo far, but mean onely the ſame with their Brethren who ſay, that thoſe words concern the Apoſtles, not onely in their own perſons, but as Prieſts, and as bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perſons of all Chriſtian Prieſts, in which capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city alone they received the Cup and were commanded by our Saviour to drink of it; whereas they received the Bread as Lay-men, and as repreſenting the whole body of private and ordinary Chriſtians. What a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change is here in the Apoſtles! they who ſat down as Lay-men, and as Lay-men took the Bread juſt before, have their capacity altered in a trice, and are made Prieſts in a moment: Yes, ſay they, ſo they were, at that very time they were made Prieſts, whilſt they were ſitting at Table with Chriſt, and Celebrating this his laſt Supper; the firſt and only ordination that ever was, either in the Jewiſh or Chriſtian Church, in the time of eating and ſiting at Table. And they may ſet up, I dare ſay, for the firſt Authors among all the Chriſtian Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that ever were of this Opinion that is now held by them; That Chriſt at his laſt Supper appointed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but two Sacraments; that of Orders as well as that of the Euchariſt; and the firſt without any proper Solemnity for ſuch a purpoſe, without any outward Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or any Words, one would think, importing any ſuch thing: But they were made Prieſts; ſay they, by vertue of thoſe words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> Do this; which Chriſt ſpake to them after he had given them the Bread. This <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36224:43"/>is a very ſhort and a quick form of Ordination; and had it been known to be one ſooner, for 'tis a very late diſcovery, I ſuppoſe the <hi>Roman</hi> Church would have kept to that in the Ordaining Prieſts, as they do to <hi>Hoc est Corpus,</hi> in Conſecrating the Sacramental Bread: But this ſhort form whereby they will have the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles made Preiſts ſo ſuddenly and unexpectedly, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to be too quick, and to make them Prieſts a little too ſoon, which is a very unlucky thing for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for Chriſt ſaid thoſe words,
<hi>Hoc facite,</hi> do this; juſt as he gave them the Bread, and ſpoke them in one continued ſentence, with, <hi>Take, eat: this is my body;</hi> ſo that whether he gave the Bread ſeverally to each of them, or they took it as it was upon the table, as it is ſaid, <hi>they divided the Cup among themſelves;</hi> it cannot be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but that thoſe words <hi>hoc facite</hi> were ſpoken by Chriſt, before the Apoſtles did receive the Bread, or at leaſt before they ate it; ſo that it might as fairly be pretended, and as truly, that the Apoſtles ate the Bread as Prieſts, as well as drank the Wine as ſuch; for they were made as much Prieſts by thoſe words, before they ate the Bread, as before they drank the Wine: If we do ſuppoſe they did receive the Bread into their hands, before thoſe words were pronounced by our Saviour; which is the moſt that can be, yet they could not eat it before they were. And ſo this fine and ſubtle Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis which they have invented to deprive the Laiety of the Cup, will deprive them of the Bread too, and will in its conſequence, and by the ſame train of arguing, tend to take away the whole Sacrament from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and make it peculiar to the Prieſts, as ſome of the Jewiſh Sacrifices were, and the People ſhall not at all partake of the Altar, but it ſhall be reſerved as a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar right and priviledge of the Prieſts, to which the Laity ought not to pretend, becauſe the Apoſtles took the Sacrament only as Prieſts, and were made Prieſts <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36224:44"/>fore they either ate the Bread or drank the Wine; this would make a greater difference and diſtinction between the Prieſts and the Laiety, and tend more to preſerve the honour and eſteem of one above the other. Which is the great reaſon they themſelves give, and no doubt a true one, for their taking away the Cup from the People; and I don't queſtion, but ſo great a Wit, and ſo elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent an Artiſt in pleading, as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> is, who can ſay a great deal for any cauſe, be it never ſo bad, may with as good grounds, and as great a ſhew of reaſon, juſtifie if he pleaſe, the taking away the whole Sacrament from the Laiety as the Cup, and may to this purpoſe improve and advance this notion of the Apoſtles, receiving both kinds as Prieſts, to prove the Laiety have a right to neither, and may take off the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of both parts as well as one, by pretending that the real effect and vertue of the Sacrament is received ſome other way, by the Sacrifice of the Maſs, or by Spiritual Manducation, or by ſome thing elſe without partaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Symbols, as well as without partaking all of them as Chriſt has appointed, for if the effect and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament depend upon Chriſts Inſtitution, then both are neceſſary, if it may be had without keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, then neither is ſo, but of this afterwards, when we come to examine his grounds and reaſons. I ſhall make ſome Reflections upon our Saviours Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament, and offer ſome conſiderations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe pretences and Sophiſtries of our Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I would ask them whither thoſe words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> do not belong to all Chriſtians as well as to the Apoſtles? if they do not, then where is there any command given to Chriſtians for to receive the Sacrament, either in both or in one kind? Where is there any command at all for Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to Celebrate or come to the Lords Supper? or to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this Chriſtian Rite, which is the peculiar mark and <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36224:44"/>badge of our Profeſſion, and the moſt ſolemn part of Chriſtian Worſhip? Thoſe words ſurely contain in them as plain a Command, and as direct an Obligation upon all Chriſtians to perform this Duty to the end of the World, as they did upon the Apoſtles at that time; or elſe we muſt ſay with the <hi>Socinians,</hi> That the Sacrament was onely a temporary Rite, that belonged onely to the Apoſtles, and was not to continue in the Church, or be obſerved by all Chriſtians in all Ages: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 11.26.</note> we <hi>do hereby ſhew, or declare the Lord's death till he come,</hi> by this ſolemn way of eating Bread broken, and Wine poured out; we are to remember Chriſt who dyed for us, and is gone into Heaven, till he come again, when we ſhall live with him, and enjoy his Preſence for ever: Chriſt has given a command to all Chriſtians to do this, and they are to <hi>Do this in remembrance of him;</hi> they are as much obliged to this, as the Apoſtles were; and the command does as much belong to the People, to receive the Sacrament, as to the Apoſtles, or to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to give it them. The Apoſtles and Chriſtian Prieſts are hereby commanded to do their parts, which is, not onely to receive, but to diſpence and diſtribute the Sacrament; and the People or Chriſtian Laiety, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to do theirs, which is, to receive it: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are to do that which Chriſt did, to Bleſs the Bread and breake it, and give it to be eaten; to bleſs the Cup, and give it to be drunk by the Communicants; and the Communicants are to eat the Bread and drink the Cup: and if they do not both of them do this that belongs to them, and perform thoſe proper parts of their Duty, which are here commanded them, they are both guilty of an unexcuſable diſobedience to this plain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> No body ever denyed that thoſe words, and this command of Chriſt, belonged to the Apoſtles; but to ſay they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to them alone, and not to all Chriſtians, is to take <pb n="10" facs="tcp:36224:45"/>away the Command and Obligation which all Chriſtians have to receive the Holy Supper.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This command of Chriſt, as it obliges all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to receive the Sacrament, the Laiety as well as the Clergy, ſo it obliges them to receive it in both kinds; and as it obliges the Clergy to give the People the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo it obliges them to give it in both kinds; for the command of <hi>Doing this in remembrance of Chriſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs as much to one kind as the other; and is as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly added concerning the Cup, as concerning the Bread; for ſo it is in St. <hi>Paul</hi> ‖ beyond all contradiction, and to the unanſwerable confuſion of our Adverſaries, who would pretend it belongs only to the Bread; <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> obſerving theſe words in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> to be added only after the giving of the Bread, for they are in nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two other Evangeliſts, falls into a mighty tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, and into a moſt Religious fit of Catholic Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, admiring the wonderful Providence of GOD,<note n="*" place="margin">Mirabilis est providentia Dei in ſanctis literis, nam ut non haberent haeretici juſtam excuſationem, ſuſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit eis omnem tergiverſando occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem: Nam Lucas illud, <hi>Hoc faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> poſuit post datum Sacramentum.

Chriſt's own Inſtitution, had there been no ſuch particular Commands to Drink, as well as to Eat, and to <hi>Do both in remembrance of him;</hi> I ſay, his own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, both by Bread and Wine, ſhould ſuffice, methinks, to ſhow us what we ſhould do, when we Celebrate the ſame Sacrament that he did; namely,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36224:46"/>uſe both Bread and Wine; and eat and drink it as was done then; if it be the ſame Sacrament that he celebrated with his Diſciples, why do not we celebrate it as he did? why ſhould we not obſerve his own Inſtitution? but without any order from him, and contrary to what he did, leave out part of it; and that part of it which is as conſiderable and as remarkable in his Inſtitution, as the other? If from the bare Inſtitution of Chriſt, all Chriſtians are bound to receive this Sacrament, which ſurely they are; then from thence they are bound as much to drink the Cup, as to eat the Bread; for both are equally inſtituted. If the Inſtitution, for of that I ſpeak now, as 'tis in St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the additional command of <hi>Do this;</hi> if that do not oblige to drink the Cup, neither does it oblige to eat the Bread; for that is no more in the Inſtitution then the other: And if the Church has ſuch a power as to take away the Cup, notwithſtanding the Inſtitution, it may have a power to take away the Bread too, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Inſtitution; for the one is as much in the Inſtitution as the other; and if the Cup be not an Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial part of the Sacrament, which is the other thing they ſay, and which the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> inſiſts on, which I ſhall examine afterwards: then neither is the Bread, ſo far as appears by the Inſtitution, and ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them may be neceſſary, and both of them may be taken away, notwithſtanding Chriſt's own Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both. Which, though it be the moſt preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous boldneſs, and the moſt horrid Sacriledge that can be, yet ſhall I ſay no more to it at preſent, but what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> does upon the like caſe, of thoſe who would omit the Wine in the Sacrament, and uſe water inſtead of it.<note n="‖" place="margin">Quod ſi nec minima deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis Chriſti licet ſolvere, quanto magis tam magna tam grandia tam ad ipſum dominicae paſſionis &amp; noſtrae Redemptionis Sacramentum pertinentia fas non eſt infringere aut in aliud quam quod divinitùs inſtitutum ſit, humanâ inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutione mutare? <hi>Cyprian ep. 63.</hi> ad Caecilium.</note>

He was aware of a difficulty, if the Apoſtles took the Cup onely as Prieſts, and by the right of Prieſts, at the firſt Inſtitution, then it would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that, to have any but Prieſts receive the Cup: And then, why is it ever given to the Laiety, as it is ſometimes by the Pope's favour and conceſſion; if it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long onely to Prieſts, and the Prieſts onely have right to it, from the firſt Inſtitution, becauſe the Apoſtles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it only as Prieſts? But ſo inconſiſtent are they to their own Principles, that they do not give the Cup, even to their Prieſts, unleſs when they themſelves Conſecrate and Officiate: None but the <hi>Miniſter Conficiens</hi> is to receive that, though never ſo many other Prieſts be by, ſo much at variance are they, between this their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, and their own practice, and ſo do they fight, even with their own ſhadows; if the Apoſtles received the Cup as Prieſts, Why then do not all Prieſts receive it, as well as the Prieſt who Conſecrates, if onely he that Conſecrates be to receive it, then by this rule, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſhould not have received it at the firſt Inſtitution, for they did not then Conſecrate? Chriſt was then alone, the
<hi>Miniſter Conficiens,</hi> and ſo according to them, he ought onely to have received it, and not the Apoſtles, and yet 'tis moſt probable that Chriſt did not himſelf receive either the Cup, or the Bread, ſo that if they will keep cloſe to this whimſical Notion of theirs, the <hi>Miniſter Conficiens</hi> is not to receive at all, but to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate and give to the other Prieſts that are preſent; but further, if the Apoſtles were made Prieſts by thoſe words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> which they ſo earneſtly contend, and ſpend ſo much Critical learning to ſhow that <hi>face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re ſignifies</hi> to Sacrifice, then they were twice made Prieſts at the ſame time, for thoſe words were ſaid by <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36224:48"/>our Saviour, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> Witneſſes, not onely after gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Bread, but repeated again alſo after the Cup, ſo that the Apoſtles were doubly Conſecrated, and the Character of Prieſts, was twice Imprinted upon them at the ſame time, which is another difficulty with which they muſt be encumbred according to their own prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, for though this Opinion be wholly Imaginary, yet like the Night-mare, 'tis a real weight lying upon them, and I ſhall leave them to ſweat under it, and get it off as well as they can.</p>

Whatever be the effects and benefits which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by partaking of this Bleſſed Sacrament, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Inſtitution of it, and are not ordinarily to be had without obſerving of that; I ſay ordinarily, becauſe Caſes of Neceſſity diſpence with poſitive pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as if a ſick man cannot ſwallow the Bread, about which there is a Proviſion in the Eleventh Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo,</hi> if the natural Infirmity of anothers Stomack be ſuch, that he cannot drink Wine, which the French Diſcipline ſpeaks of, and which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 181.</note> makes an Objection againſt them, if the place be ſuch that no Wine is to be had or procured, as in <hi>Norway</hi> where Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Eighth allowed them to Celebrate without Wine; in thoſe extraordinary Caſes, God has not ſo tied the inward Grace to the outward Signe, but that he can give it without it; as if a Catechumen wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and deſirous of Baptiſm, die without it, becauſe he could not have it, yet the Church has always ſuppoſed he may have the benefit of it, and ſo I charitably hope that the Pious and Religious Laiety in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſhall have the benefit of the Blood of Chriſt, though they are deprived of it in the Sacrament, and through the meer fault of their Governours, and of their Prieſts, are excluded from it, and forced to violate the Divine Inſtitution, which is all that <hi>Calixtus</hi> and others which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P.

Monſieur <hi>de Meaux,</hi> will needs have the whole fruit, and vertue, and eſſential effect of the Sacrament, to be given by one ſpecies, which is the great principle he goes upon, which I ſhall more fully examine afterwards, but if the vertue and eſſential ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect depend upon the Inſtitution, and it can depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on nothing elſe, and if both ſpecies be inſtituted by Chriſt, as I have ſhown, then the vertue and effect depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both ſpecies, and not upon one. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> asks,
<hi>Whether in the very moment, the Body of our Lord is received, all the effects be not likewiſe received</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 328.</note>? I anſwer No, becauſe all that is required in the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not then received. He farther asks, <hi>Whether the blood can add any thing eſſential?</hi> I anſwer Yes, becauſe that alſo is in the Inſtitution; if one of the Apoſtles had ſtopt our Saviour, when he had given them the Bread, <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36224:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>and told them this was his Body, and askt him this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry queſtion, I ask, whither he thinks this would have hindred him from going on with the Cup, becauſe they had already received the whole vertue and effect of the Sacrament without that; and nothing eſſential could be added by that? Chriſt, it ſeems by the Inſtitution, did go on to the Cup, after he had given the other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to ſay, he did not give any eſſential vertue, or efficacy by the Cup, is an unwarrantable boldneſs, and blaſphemous impudence, which may as well deny, that he gave any by the Bread; this is to make the Cup a very empty ſigne, and naked figure, devoid of all inward vertue and efficacy, and to ſerve as <hi>de Meaux</hi> would have it, onely for Repreſentation, and a more full and expreſs Signification<note n="*" place="margin">P. 176.</note>, in which he joyns us to the Cup, with thoſe his Adverſaries, who have the meaneſt thoughts of the Sacrament, and indeed, it is to make the Cup wholly ſuperfluous, and unneceſſary, as to the conveying or exhibiting any real Vertue, or inward Grace, which is to be received thereby, and as Monſieur
<hi>de Meaux</hi> is forced to own, when he anſwers that demand, to what purpoſe then, was the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both ſpecies<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 179.</note>? to make it only a more full Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Repreſentation of the Sacrifice of Chriſt, but not to give us any of the vertue or efficacy of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ,</hi> he ſays, <hi>cannot ſeparate the vertue, or effect, that any other Grace ſhould accompany his blood, then the ſame in ground and ſubſtance which accompanys his body</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 182.</note>, but he can make the whole Vertue and Grace accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and depend upon both the Sacramental Body, and Sacramental Blood together, and ſo he has done by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, according to which, the Sacramental Grace is not to be expected ordinarily, without both; but he may deprive thoſe Perſons wholly of this, who violate his Inſtitution, and who receive not both ſpecies, as he has appointed and commanded team; which is a very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36224:50"/>conſideration, which ſhould make men afraid to dare to alter any ſuch thing as Chriſt's own Inſtitution, upon which the whole vertue of the Sacraments does depend.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. 'Tis from the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, that we know what belongs to the ſubſtance of it, and is eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to it, and what is onely circumſtantial and accidental: I own there were ſeveral things, even at the Inſtitution of it by Chriſt, which were onely circumſtantials; as the place where, the time when, the number of perſons, to whom, the poſture in which he gave it; for all theſe are plainly, and in their own nature, circumſtantial matters; ſo that no body can think it neceſſary or eſſential to the Sacrament, that it be Celebrated in an upper Room, at night after Supper, onely with twelve perſons, and thoſe ſitting or lying upon Beds, as the Jews uſed to do at Meals; for the ſame thing which Chriſt bids them do, may be done, the ſame Sacramental Action performed in another place, at another time, with fewer or more perſons, and thoſe otherwiſe poſtured or ſituated; but it cannot be the ſame Sacrament or ſame Action, if Bread be not bleſſed and eaten, if Wine be not bleſſed and drunken, as they were both then bleſſed by Chriſt, and eaten and drunk by his Apoſtles: The doing of theſe is not a circumſtance, but the very thing it ſelf, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſtance and eſſence of the Sacrament; for without theſe we do not do what Chriſt did, whereas we may do the very ſame thing which he did, without any of thoſe circumſtances with which he did it: Thus in the other Sacrament of Baptiſm or waſhing with water, whether that be done by waſhing the whole body in immerſion, or by waſhing a part of the Body in ſprinkling, is but a circumſtance, that is not neceſſary or eſſential to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but to waſh with Water, is the very thing in which Baptiſm conſiſts, and the very ſubſtance of the Sacrament which is eſſential and unalterable; the quantity of Water with which we waſh is not, no more is the quantity of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:36224:50"/>Bread and Wine which we eat and drink in the Sacrament but eating Bread and drinking Wine is as eſſential to the Euchariſt, as waſhing with Water is to Baptiſm.

<hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of thoſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men did this, I ſhall never blame the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor any of his Succeſſors for doing it afterwards, and if they did it juſt after they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, and had that in ſuch a Miraclous manner given unto them; I ſhall conclude, it was not the office of that bleſſed Spirit <hi>to bring all things to their remembrance which Christ had ſaid unto them,</hi> as he told them it ſhould be, but to teach them things quite contrary to what he had a little before commanded and appointed them: And it will be more ſtrange if Chriſt himſelf, after his Reſurrection, ſhould give the Sacrament in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner then he had done four days before. Let us therefore examine thoſe places from which all theſe ſtrange things are pretended, and ſee if any ſuch matter is to be found in them, which I confeſs, will be very ſurprizing, if they be: As to the firſt, St. <hi>Luke</hi> tells us,
<hi>Chap.</hi> 24. That the ſame day Chriſt was riſen, two of the Diſciples, the name of one of which was <hi>Cleophas,</hi> going to
<hi>Emmaus,</hi> a Village near to <hi>Hieruſalem;</hi> Chriſt, as they were Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muning together about him and his Reſurrection, drew near, and went along with them, and diſcourſt to them about thoſe things, as a perſon unknown; and going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Houſe and <hi>fitting at meat with them, he took bread and bleſſed it, and brake, and gave to them,</hi> v. 30. Here, ſay they, Chriſt gave the Sacrament, and gave it onely in Bread, for <hi>he took bread and bleſſed, and brake, and gave to them;</hi> which are the very words uſed at his giving his laſt Supper: But muſt Chriſt always be ſuppoſed to give the Sacrament whenever <hi>he took bread and bleſſed, and brake it, and gave it to</hi> others? Then he did ſo when he filled the five thouſand with five Loaves and two <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36224:52"/>Fiſhes, for then

And ſo he did when he filled four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at another time, <hi>he took the ſeven loaves and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his diſciples to ſet before them,</hi> Mark 8.6. Here though he bleſſed the Bread, and gave thanks, as was always the cuſtom of Pious and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Men, at their ordinary meals, and though he brake the Bread, which is a Jewiſh phraſe for diſtributing and giving it; yet it cannot in the leaſt be pretended, that in any of theſe places he gave the Sacrament, nor is there any manner of reaſon to ſuppoſe he did ſo at <hi>Emmaus,</hi> with theſe Diſciples, but to ſatisfie them of the truth, of himſelf and his Reſurrection; he took meat with them, as he did afterwards with the Eleven Apoſtles, and by his behaviour at Table, and by his form of Bleſſing, which was probably the ſame he uſed at other times, and by thus ſeeing and converſing with him more intimately at Table, they came to underſtand who it was, and <hi>their eyes were opened, and they knew him,</hi> or as is <hi>v.</hi> 35. <hi>he was known to them in breaking of bread;</hi> that is, in eating with him, not that any thing miraculous or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary was here ſhewn by Chriſt, or wrought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, any more than was to the Apoſtles afterwards, to whom he ſhewed himſelf likewiſe, and took meat with them, to give them full ſatisfaction, that it was the ſame perſon who was Crucified, and who was riſen with the ſame Body he had before; or if they were illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their eyes open'd in an extraordinary manner at that time; yet it was not neceſſary this ſhould be done by the Sacrament, of all the vertues of which, the opening mens eyes, and curing them of Infidelity, is the leaſt to be aſcribed to it, ſince it is onely to be taken by thoſe who do believe, and whoſe eyes are opened before, though this may ſometimes be applyed to it, by way of Allegory and alluſion, as it is by St. <hi>Auſtine, Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact,</hi>

4.4. the ſame is imported. To break Bread, was an uſual Hebrew expreſſion, for giving all manner of food, as appears by thoſe inſtances, ſo that when Bread, which is but one part of food, is expreſſed; yet the other is included and meant alſo, as when Chriſt
<hi>went into the houſe of one of the chief Phariſes to eat bread,</hi> Luke 14.1. we cannot ſuppoſe that he had only ſuch a dry Banquet, as not to drink with him too, and when <hi>Joſeph</hi> told the Steward of his houſe, that he ſhould prepare an entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his brethren, <hi>for they are to eat with me at noon,</hi> Gen. 43.16. <hi>hodie ſunt mecum comeſturi,</hi> as in the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> he did not I ſuppoſe, think they were not to drink with him too, and that he was not to provide Wine, as well as other Victuals, neither did <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s own Brethren, ſuſpect he would ſend them away dry and thirſty, when they onely heard that they ſhould <hi>eat bread there,</hi> v. 25.

But he is a bold man, that dare face the mouth of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, who dare undertake to prove the Communion in one kind, out of the eleventh Chapter of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians;</hi> which is ſuch a perfect demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration againſt it, that a man muſt out-face the Sun, who offers at any ſuch thing.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul,</hi> as the beſt and trueſt means to correct the abuſes got into the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> about the Euchariſt, recurs to the Inſtitution which he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Chriſt himſelf, and which he delivered to the Church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> in which there is ſo full an account of both the ſpecies, and ſuch a command of both, as is ſufficient to ſhew the Apoſtolical practice confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and to let us ſee what Tradition they left in their Churches about it. Had there been any difference between the Prieſts and the Peoples receiving the Bread and Wine; St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who wrote to the Laiety, would no doubt have taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, and told them their reſpective duties; but he delivers the Inſtitution to them, juſt as Chriſt did to his Apoſtles; ſays not a tittle of their not being to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Cup, but on the contrary, adds that command to it, which is in none of the Evangoliſts, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me;</hi> Gives not the leaſt intimation, that this was given to the Apoſtles as Prieſts, or that they were made Prieſts then; but what is obſervable, does not ſo much as mention the Apoſtles, or take any notice of the perſons that were preſent at the Inſtitution, and to whom the words, <hi>Do this,</hi> were ſpoken. So, that ſo far as appears from him, they might be ſpoken to other Diſciples, to ordinary Laics; nay, to the women who might be preſent at this firſt Sacrament, as well as the Apoſtles; and ſo muſt have been made Prieſts by thoſe <pb n="30" facs="tcp:36224:55"/>words, <hi>Hoc facite,</hi> as well as they. After the recital of the Inſtitution, in which he obſerves no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Prieſts and Laics; he tells the Faithful of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that as often as they did eat this Bread and drink this Cup, <hi>they ſhewed forth the Lord's death, till he come:</hi> So that they who were to ſhew forth Chriſt's death, as well as the Prieſts, were to do it both by eating the Bread and drinking the Cup; and, indeed, one of them does not ſhew forth his death ſo well as both; for it does not ſhew his Blood ſeparated from his Body. He goes on to ſhew 'um the guilt of unworthy eating and drinking, for he all along joyns both thoſe Acts, as a phraſe, ſignifying the Communion; and he expreſly uſes it no leſs than four times in that Chapter: But in ſome Copies, ſay they, inſtead of
<hi>and,</hi> he uſes the particle <hi>or,</hi> in the 27 <hi>v. Whoſoever ſhall eat this bread, or drink this cup unworthily:</hi> and here Monſieur
<hi>Boileau</hi> would gladly find ſomething for either Eating or Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without doing both; which is ſuch a ſhift and cavil, as nothing would make a man catch at, but ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate cauſe as has nothing elſe to be ſaid for it: If the particle <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, though I think no ſuch weight bears upon the difference of theſe particles, as to make it worth our while to examine them; for if the Apoſtles did disjoyn them, it was onely
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36224:55"/>to lay a greater Emphaſis upon the guilt of unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy eating and drinking, which though they both go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, yet are both very great Sins; and I ſee no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conſequence, that becauſe a man may both eat and drink unworthily, that therefore he ſhould onely eat, and not drink at all; or that the Apoſtles ſuppoſed it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to eat without drinking, or drink without eating.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtolical practice, and the Inſtitution of our Saviour, for Communion in both kinds, though it be very plain and clear in Scripture, and being founded upon ſo full a Command, and a Divine Inſtitution; I know no Power in the Church to alter it, or vary from it; yet it will be further confirmed, and ſtrengthened by the Univerſal Practice of the whole Chriſtian Church, and of the pureſt Ages after the Apoſtles, and by the general conſent of Antiquity, for a thouſand years and more after Chriſt; in which I ſhall prove the Euchariſt was always given to all the Faithful, who came to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip; and to the Communion in both kinds, without any difference made between the Prieſts and the Laiety, as to this matter, which was a thing never heard of in Antiquity, nor ever ſo much as mentioned in any Author, till after the Twelfth Century; in which wretched times of Ignorance and Superſtition, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation being newly brought in, ſtruck men with ſuch horror, and Superſtitious Reverence of the ſacred Symbols, which they believed to be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the very ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body and Blood; that they begun to be afraid of taking that part which was fluid and might be ſpilt, each drop of which they thought to be the ſame blood that flowed out of the ſide of Chriſt, and the very ſubſtantial Blood that was running in his Veins, and now by a miraculous way, was conveyed into the Chalice. Hence at firſt, they u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Pipes and Quils to ſuck it out of the Cup, and ſome uſed intinction or dipping of the Bread in the Wine; <pb n="32" facs="tcp:36224:56"/>and afterwards the ſame ſuperſtition increaſing, they came to leave off, and abſtaine wholly from drinking the Cup; which was reſerved onely to the more ſacred lips of the Prieſts, who were willing to be hereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſht from the more unworthy and prophane Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Council of

<hi>Julius,</hi> to have been the manner of ſome, who though they were very blameable, and juſtly cenſured for ſo doing; yet they hereby confeſt, that there ought to be two ſpecies given in the Sacrament, a liquid one, as well as a ſolid: The <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and the <hi>Manichees,</hi> are the onely Chriſtians that ever thought otherwiſe. When the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation began to creep into the Church, in the time of

                  <p>And now having given ſo full a proof that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, was the Practice of the Primitive Church, which I have done ſo largely, becauſe Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has the face to deny this, and to attempt to prove the contrary; it will be very ſtrange if after ſo many Affirmative Evidences, who all unanimouſly and poſitively declare that the Communion was always in both kinds, there ſhould be any Negative Teſtimonies produced to the contrary, who ſhall fully contradict theſe, and depoſe that it was very often the cuſtom of the Church to Communicate but in one. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> has made it his buſineſs to do this, and brings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances out of Antiquity to ſhew, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion was very frequently given in the Primitive Church but in one kind, as <hi>in the Communion of the Sick, the Communion of Infants, Domeſtic Communion,</hi> and which, as he tells us, is very ſurprizing, <hi>the Public Communion in the Church.</hi> If he can but make out one of theſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, to wit, the latter, that of Public Communion in <pb n="59" facs="tcp:36224:69"/>the Church, it will be much more conſiderable than all his other; for if they ſhould prove true, namely, that in particular and extraordinary caſes of neceſſity, to which we know all poſitive precepts are to give way; the Communion was given but in one kind to thoſe who were uncapable to receive both, as to ſick Perſons and Children, or that in times of Perſecution Chriſtians did carry home onely the Bread with them, that ſo they might eat it in private, when they could not ſo conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently carry home the Wine; What will this ſignifie to the juſtifying the Conſtant and Public Communions in one kind, when there are no ſuch particular or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary reaſons for it, and the eſtabliſhing this by a Law, as a ſtanding and neceſſary Practice to be obſerved by the whole Church? The doing this, is as if the <hi>Jews,</hi> becauſe whilſt they were in the Wilderneſs they could not ſo well obſerve the Precept of Circumciſion, and ſo were at that time for a particular reaſon excuſed from it, ſhould ever after have omitted it as unneceſſary, and have thought fit at laſt to forbid it by a Law of their <hi>Sanhedrim:</hi> This ſure had been making too bold with a poſitive Precept, although there might be a particular caſe or inſtance wherein it was not ſo exactly to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved: Every Chriſtian is obliged to have and to read the Word of God, notwithſtanding that there may be inſtances of ſome who are Dumb or Blind, who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and ſo excuſed from thoſe otherwiſe neceſſary duties, as the Sick and the Captives, and the Deaf are, from coming to Public Prayers and Public Worſhip; and where there are the like particular exceptions, and as particular reaſons for not receiving the Sacrament in both kinds, as in the Sick, and Infants, who cannot ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Bread, the <hi>Abſtemii,</hi> who naturally abhor Wine and the like, there without any derogating to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law of Chriſt, they may be diſpenſed withal by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that neceſſity, which takes away the obligation of <pb n="60" facs="tcp:36224:70"/>all poſitive Laws; but it will not at all follow from hence, that the Law does not oblige in all other caſes. If Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> therefore could prove, as he offers to do, but upon what falſe, or at leaſt dubious grounds, I ſhall conſider by and by, that the Sick and Infants who could not ſwallow the Bread did receive onely the Wine; and that in the times of Perſecution when they could not come ſo often to the public Communion, that they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated at home onely of tha Bread which they could carry away and keep ſafely by them, when they could not ſo well either keep or carry away the Wine; this will by no means juſtifie the ſingle Communion to all perſons, and at all other times, when there is no ſuch particular neceſſity or extraordinary reaſon for it: Though they might in thoſe caſes hope for the benefit of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and not doubt but that God would beſtow it upon them, though they received but in one kind, when they could not receive both, yet there is not the ſame reaſon to expect it at other times when we may, and ſo are obliged to both; as the <hi>Jews</hi> whilſt in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might hope to enjoy all the benefits of Circumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and being in Covenant with God, though they did not then obſerve the Law and Inſtitution of that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but this they could not expect, but would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have forfeited, if they did not punctually obſerve it afterwards as it was commanded them.</p>
                  <p>And as for the two inſtances he brings of Public Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Church in one kind, as on <hi>Good-Friday</hi> in the <hi>Latine</hi> Church, and all <hi>Lent</hi> in the <hi>Maſs of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified,</hi> in the <hi>Greek,</hi> were thoſe true, as I ſhall ſhew they are not, but that both Species were uſed in both thoſe Communions, yet they being ſuch Communions as were particular to thoſe days, and remarkably diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Communions at all other times of the year, would plainly prove, that the ordinary and uſual Communions upon all other other days, and at all other
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36224:70"/>times, were conſtantly in both kinds in the
<hi>Latine</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> Church: If they were not, why are theſe pickt out by him as <hi>ſingle Inſtances</hi> of Communions in one kind? By this he plainly acknowledges, that theſe differed from the <hi>ſtated</hi> and <hi>conſtant Communions,</hi> and ſo confeſſes that
<hi>thoſe</hi> were in both kinds: And though he ventures to ſay, that in the ordinary Office the Church received ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther both ſpecies, or one onely; yet this is ſo wholly without any ſhadow of proof, that I wonder he would expoſe the credit of his learning, or his honeſty upon ſo notorious a falſhood, that has not the leaſt Fig-leave to cover its ſhame; for as to the decrees of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> againſt Communicating in one kind, to make theſe an Argument for it, is a piece of ſuch refined art and skill, as no body but <hi>de Meaux</hi> could have found out or made uſe of; but becauſe the ſtrength of his Book lies upon the truth of theſe Inſtances of his, though I think that be already ſhaken, yet I ſhall take it down to the very foundation, and ſhew how weak that is, and how unable to bear what he would build upon it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Cuſtom he alledges of Communion in one kind, is

<hi>neceſſary</hi> to make it a true Sacrament, and that neither the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, nor the vertue and benefit of them could be given without both: and this forces <hi>de Meaux</hi> to confeſs<note n="†" place="margin">P. 52.</note>, after all his ſhifts and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, that <hi>in effect, it is true that in ſome ſenſe, to be able to call it the Body and the Bloud, the two Species must be given.</hi> And further, from hence alſo the whole Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Tranſubſtantiation and Concomitancy ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, whereby they ſuppoſe the Body and Bloud of Chriſt to be in either of the Species, is wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and deſtroyed; but this by the by: as to
<hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion,</hi> it is ſtrange that the Prieſt ſhould not rather have ſent him the Wine alone, if he had intended him but one Species, that being more fit to be received, and more proper <hi>to enter the parcht throat of an agonizing man,</hi> as <pb n="64" facs="tcp:36224:72"/>

<hi>Paulinus</hi> who wrote his Life, relates this of his Death, That Honoratus
<hi>Biſhop of</hi> Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceills, <hi>being to viſit him in the night whilst he was at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he heard this Voice three times,</hi> Riſe, ſtay not, he is a dying: <hi>He went down and gave him the Body of our Lord, and the Saint had no ſooner received it, but he gave up the Ghost.</hi> So that it ſeems he died and received on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one kind; but who can help that, if he did, if he died before he could receive the other, as it is probable from the Hiſtory he did: If the <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts did like <hi>Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> give onely the Bread to thoſe, who when they have received it die before they can take the Cup; this would be a very juſtifiable excuſe, and needs no great Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to defend it; but if they will undertake to prove that St.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> had time enough to have received the Cup as well as the Bread before he died, which they muſt meerly by ſuppoſing ſome thing more than is in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; then by the very ſame way I will prove that he did receive the Cup, and that that by a Syneckdoche is to be underſtood as well as the Bread, by the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt which he is there ſaid to receive: And I am ſure I have a better argument for this than they can have againſt it, or than theſe two Inſtances of <hi>Serapion</hi> and St.
<hi>Ambroſe</hi> are for the cuſtom of Communicating the Sick in one
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36224:72"/>kind, and that is a full proof of a contrary cuſtom for their Communicating in both: I confeſs I cannot produce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very ancient teſtimonies for this, becauſe in the firſt Ages the <hi>faithful</hi> who uſed to receive the Communion very frequently in public, it being in its ſelf and its own nature a true part of public Worſhip, did ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take it upon their Death beds in private<note n="†" place="margin">Vide Dallae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de Cult. <hi>l. 4. c. 3.</hi>

                     <hi>The Communion of Infants</hi> is the next cuſtom alledged by this Author;<note place="margin">Communion of Infants.</note> it was a very ancient, and almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice of the Church, to give the Euchariſt to little Children as ſoon as they were Baptized, thinking it to be as neceſſary to their Salvation as Baptiſm, and that they were as capable of the one as the other; and therefore the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which has condemned all thoſe who ſay the Euchariſt is neceſſary for Infants, has herein determined againſt the general ſence and practice of the Church, and put no leſs men than St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and
<hi>Innocent,</hi> a Pope of their own, <hi>notwithſtanding his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility,</hi> who were notoriouſly of this Opinion, under an

<hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, that ſo theſe men might be made manifest to them by theſe marks and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, that their ſacrilegious diſimulation being apprehended, they might be markt and diſcovered, and ſo expelled or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36224:80"/>from the ſociety of the Faithful, by the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Authority.</hi> Now how can all this, which ſhews plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Communion at <hi>Rome</hi> was in both kinds, be turned to the advantage of Communion in one; this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the ſlight and the dexterity of Monſieur
<hi>de Meaux,</hi> and 'tis one of the moſt artificial fetches that ever were; It is the onely argument which he has to prove that the Public Communion was not in both kinds; This remark upon the words of Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and upon the Decree of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſius.</hi> which is much of the like nature;
<hi>This fraudulent deſign,</hi> ſays he, <hi>of the</hi> Manichees,
<hi>could hardly be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe Catholics themſelves did not all of them Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate under both Species.</hi> But how knows he that? That is the queſtion that is not to be begged, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and 'tis a ſtrange way of proving it by no other <hi>medium</hi> but onely <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> it, and that very groundleſly and unreaſonably: Is this poor weak ſuppoſition to bear the weight of that bold aſſertion which contradicts all manner of Evidence and Authority, that the Public Communion in the Church was in one kind? If it had been ſo, and Catholics had not all of them Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under both Species, the <hi>Manichees</hi> would not have been diſcovered at all, for they would have done the ſame the Catholics did, and to all outward appearance been as good Catholics as they; they might have kept their Opinion and Hereſie to themſelves, and that it ſeems they intended to diſſemble and keep private; but as to their <hi>Practice</hi> it would have been but the ſame with others, and ſo they could not have been found out or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered by <hi>that; But it was taken notice of at the last,</hi> ſays <hi>de Meaux, that theſe Heretics did it out of affectation, inſomuch that the holy Pope, St.</hi> Leo <hi>the Great, would that thoſe who were known as ſuch by this mark, ſhould be expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Church.</hi> How does it appear that their <hi>affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was taken notice of? or that they did it out of that? does Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſay any thing of this? but onely points at <pb n="81" facs="tcp:36224:80"/>their Practice without ſo much as intimating their <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi> Was their <hi>affectation</hi> the
<hi>mark</hi> by which the Pope would have them known? As <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſlighly, but not honeſtly, makes him ſpeak, by putting thoſe words of his, as relating to his own that went before, whereas in <hi>Leo</hi> they relate not to the doing it outof <hi>affectation,</hi> for he ſpeaks not a word of that, but meerly to the <hi>not drinking the Bloud;</hi> This was the onely mark <hi>by which they were known as ſuch;</hi> by theſe
<hi>indicia,</hi> theſe <hi>marks</hi> and <hi>tokens</hi> of not drinking the Bloud, they were to be known, and diſcovered, and made <hi>manifest,</hi> according to the words of St. <hi>Leo,</hi> by their <hi>viſible Practice,</hi> not by their <hi>Opinion</hi> or their <hi>Affectation;</hi> and for this they were to be expelled the Society of Chriſtians, becauſe they refuſed to drink the Bloud of our Redemption, without regard to their private or particular reaſons, which St. <hi>Leo</hi> takes no notice of: Theſe cunning and diſſembling He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retics to cover their diſſimulation and infidelity, and hide themſelves the better, which was it ſeems their main end and deſign, might take the Cup, but yet not drink of it nor taſt the leaſt drop of Wine; and <hi>for this cauſe there must have been time and a particular vigilance to diſcern theſe Heretics from amongst the Faithful,</hi> and not becauſe <hi>there was a general liberty to receive one or both Species;</hi> as <hi>de Meaux</hi> pretends, That <hi>liberty</hi> is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange thing which has no manner of evidence for it, <hi>which</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> ſays nothing of, but the quite contrary, namely, that the Body and Bloud were both received in the Communion; and <hi>which</hi> if it had been allowed, as it would have bred infinite confuſion in the Church, ſo the <hi>Manichees</hi> might have made uſe of it to their wicked purpoſe, of receiving onely in one kind.

Surely the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of words and arguments muſt be annihilated and tranſubſtantiated into quite another thing, before this can be done: Let us ſee another tryal of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s skill, <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> ſays he, <hi>was obliged to forbid expreſly to Communicate any other ways then under both Species: A ſigne that the thing was free before, and that they would not have thought of making this Ordinance, but to take from the</hi> Manicheans <hi>the means of deceiving.</hi> Was it then free till the time of Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> to receive either in one or both kinds? does any ſuch thing appear in the whole Chriſtian Church? or is there any inſtance of any one Public Communion without both kinds? is a Decree of a Church-Governour upon a <hi>particular occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> againſt <hi>particular Heretics</hi> and ſuperſtitious Perſons new roſe up, and perſuant to a general Law of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the Cuſtom of the whole Church? is that a ſign the thing was free before?

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:36224:81"/>ſuch and ſuch Councils and Biſhops commanded them to come at ſuch times: Then it was free for the Prieſts who miniſter'd, to receive but in one kind, before this Decree of
<hi>Gelaſius,</hi> for 'tis to thoſe it is refer'd in <hi>Gratian,</hi> where the title of it is, <hi>The Priest ought not to receive the Body of Christ, without the Bloud</hi>

                     </note>; and it ſeems plainly to concern neither the Prieſt nor the Faithful, who by a conſtant and univerſal cuſtom recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in both kinds, but onely thoſe
<hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> perſons who were then at <hi>Rome,</hi> and, for I know not what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, refuſed the Cup; and though there was a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſon to make this Decree againſt them, yet there needed no reaſon to make a Decree for the Faithful, who always Communicated in both kinds, and it is plain from hence, did ſo in the time of <hi>Gelaſius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The motive inducing this Pope to make this Decree was, becauſe he found that ſome did not receive the Blood as well as the Body; and the reaſon why they did not, was ſome either <hi>Manichean</hi> or other <hi>Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> ſo that this Decree, I own, was occaſioned by them, and particularly relates to them, and ſhews that they herein differed from the Faithful, not onely in their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, but in the practice too; but to ſay that he forbad this practice onely in reſpect of ſuch a Superſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on going along with it, and that he did not forbid the Practice <hi>it ſelf,</hi> which was the effect of it, is ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly falſe, that the Decree relates wholly to the <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> and as to the <hi>Superſtition</hi> it does not inform us what it was, or wherein it conſiſted; no doubt it muſt be ſome Superſtition or other, that hinders any from ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Cup, the ſuperſtitious fear of ſpilling Chriſt's Blood, or the ſuperſtitious belief that one Species con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both the Body and Bloud together, and ſo conveys <pb n="84" facs="tcp:36224:82"/>the whole vertue of both; which is truely Superſtition, as having no foundation in Scripture, or in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, which gives the Sacrament its whole ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and and annexs it not to one but to both Species. And whatever the Superſtition be, <hi>Gelaſius</hi> declares it is Sacriledge to divide the Myſtery, or to take one Species without the other; the
<hi>reaſon</hi> which he gives againſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one kind, is

Theſe holy Popes did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as ſome imagine, appoint the uſe of both Species by a new Decree, but thoſe who neglected this ſolemn and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved cuſtom of taking the Cup; one of theſe Popes would have them avoided and markt as thoſe, who were a-kin to the</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nichean
<hi>Hereſie; the other would have them compelled to the accuſtomed perception of the entire Sacrament, or elſe to be wholly kept from all Communion, for there was need of no new Decree for the Catholics who did Religiouſly obſerve the received cuſtom of taking the Sacrament entirely, that is, in both kinds.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There needs much better Arguments to prove the Public Communion in the Church to have been ever in one kind, than ſuch improbable Gueſſes and forced Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, whereby plain and full evidences are rackt and tortured to get that out of them, which is contrary to their whole teſtimony, ſenſe, and meaning.

<hi>by the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of both Churches:</hi> If it be <hi>but</hi> practiced in both Churches, this will go a great way to make it a Practice of the Catholic Church; though neither of thoſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſingly, nor both of them together, do make the Catholic: But let us ſee how this is practiced in thoſe two great, though particular Churches, <hi>Why in the Office of</hi> Good-Friday, <hi>in the</hi> Latine <hi>Church, and the Office of the</hi> Greek <hi>Church every day in</hi> Lent, <hi>except</hi> Saturday <hi>and</hi>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:36224:83"/>Sunday; at thoſe times it ſeems, theſe two Churches have the Communion onely in one kind, as appears by their public Offices; if they have it ſo at thoſe times, at other times then, I ſuppoſe, they have it in both, or elſe how come thoſe <hi>particular times,</hi> and thoſe <hi>particular Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> to be <hi>ſingled out</hi> and remarked as diſtinct and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from all the reſt; then generally and for the moſt part the Public Communion is to be in both kinds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tradition of both thoſe Churches; and then ſurely this Tradition which is thus <hi>conſecrated</hi> by both the Churches,<note place="margin">Of the Maſs on <hi>Good-Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church.</note> is violated by the <hi>Roman:</hi> But the Prieſt himſelf who officiates, takes but in one kind, in the <hi>Miſſa Paraſceues,</hi> as they call it, or the <hi>Maſs</hi> on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> as appears by the Office; this cuſtom then will ſhew that the Prieſt himſelf, or the <hi>Miniſter Conficiens,</hi> may receive onely in one kind in the Public Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as well as the People, which I think they ordinarily think unlawful, and call it Sacriledge if he ſhould ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily do ſo; and if I remember,

<hi>de Meaux</hi>'s credit, finding nothing like it in this <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> yet to a man that believes Tranſubſtantiation, and thinks the moſt minute particle of the Species of Wine or Bread contains in a miraculous manner the whole ſubſtance of Chriſt's Body and Blood, this difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty methinks might in ſome meaſure be ſalved, however ſmall parts of the Wine may be ſuppoſed to remain in the crums of Bread; and as the <hi>Greeks</hi> when they mix the Wine and the Bread together for the Sick and Infants, yet believe that they give both the Species, however ſmall the
<hi>margaritae</hi> or crums be which are in the Wine, ſo they do the ſame as to the <hi>preſanctified</hi> Bread, however few unexhaled particles of Wine remain in it: But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> knows very well, and acknowledges that the <hi>Greeks</hi> do further provide againſt a meer
<hi>dry</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in this Office, by mixing this ſacred Bread with more Wine and Water at the time of the Communion; and then, as I proved, in the caſe of the <hi>Latine Office</hi> on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> that the unconſecrated Wine was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="94" facs="tcp:36224:87"/>by this mixture and by the Prayers and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings that were uſed at that Solemnity; ſo by this way as well as by the firſt mixture of ſome drops of Wine with the Bread, the Communion in both kinds will be ſecured in the <hi>Greek Church,</hi> in their Office of the <hi>Preſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified;</hi> and to put it out of all doubt, that this is ſuch a Communion, let us but look into their Office, and we ſhall find there it plainly is ſo: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſay the Faithful, in their Prayer before the Communion, <hi>the immaculate Body and the quickning Bloud of Christ, are here to be ſet before us on this myſtical Table</hi>

                  <p>And now having ſo fully ſhewen the univerſal conſent and conſtant and perpetual Practice of the Church for Communion in both kinds, and having anſwered all the Inſtances by which <hi>de Meaux</hi> vainly endeavours to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw that: I have, I hope, in ſome meaſure perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what was the ſubject of <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Prayer at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his Treatiſe, <hi>That not onely Antiquity may be il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated, but that Truth alſo may become manifest and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 9.</note>. And I have hereby wholly taken away the main ſtrength, and the very foundation of his Book, for that lies in thoſe ſeveral cuſtoms and pretended matters of fact which he brings to juſtifie the Churches practice for ſingle Communion; and if theſe be all falſe and miſtaken, as upon examination they appear to be, then his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples upon which he founds this wrong practice, if they are not falſe and erronious, yet they are uſeleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant, for they do not <hi>prove,</hi> but onely <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> the Churches practice; and if the practice be not true, as it is plain it is not, then what ſignifie thoſe principles which are wholly grounded upon a wrong
<hi>ſuppoſal,</hi> and are one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned to make out that which never was? Thoſe principles are like framing an Hypotheſis to give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reaſon of ſome ſtrange and extraordinary thing, which thing upon enquiry, proves falſe and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and ſo they are but like the
<hi>Virtuoſo's</hi> ſolution of a Phoenominon, which, nothwithſtanding all his Philoſophic <pb n="96" facs="tcp:36224:88"/>fancy and fine <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> never was in Nature. Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> muſt better prove to us the Practice of the Church for Communion in one kind, then he has yet done, before he eſtabliſhes ſuch Principles, by which ſuch a Practiſe may be made out; for whatever the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be, as long as the <hi>Practice</hi> is falſe, the Principles will not make it true. And ſince I have ſo largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that Communion in both kinds, was the Practice of the Primitive and the whole Catholick Church for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twelve hundred years, and have diſproved all the inſtances of <hi>de Meaux</hi> to the contrary, ſo that no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of queſtion can be made of the truth of this matter of fact, unleſs where, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, <hi>Paſſion makes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated perſons undertake and believe any thing</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 164.</note>: I have ſufficiently anſwered that part of <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s Book, wherein the ſtrength of the whole lies, and that which is the ground and foundation of all the reſt being deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the other falls of its ſelf; I might therefore ſpare my ſelf the trouble of Examining the Principles which
<hi>de Meaux</hi> layes down, as the Reaſons of the Churches practice; for if the Practice of the Church be againſt him, the <hi>reaſons</hi> of that Practice will be ſo too, and I may turn thoſe upon him as I have done the other: His third Principle, which is the moſt conſiderable, and <hi>which alone,</hi> he ſays, <hi>carries along with it, the deciſion of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 194.</note>, namely, That
<hi>the Law ought to be explained by conſtant and perpetual Practice,</hi> this is wholly for us, who are aſſured that we have the conſtant and perpetual Practice of the Church for ſo many Ages for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in both kinds, and therefore though the Law of Chriſt, which is ſo clear in it ſelf, that it needs nothing to explain it, be the main thing upon which the deciſion of this matter depends, yet the Tradition and Practice of the Church is a farther confirmation of the Law to us, and we ſhall be willing to joyn with <hi>de Meaux</hi> in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he can ſay for <hi>Tradition,</hi> provided it be ſo certain <pb n="97" facs="tcp:36224:88"/>and general and authentic, as we have proved it to be for Communion in both kinds, and provided that it do not deſtroy a plain Law of Chriſt, nor <hi>make void the Commandment of God,</hi> which we can never believe that an univerſal Tradition of the Catholic Church ever will do: What a vain and empty flouriſh ſome are uſed to make with a name of <hi>Tradition</hi> and the <hi>Church:</hi> I have ſhewn in this queſtion of the Communion in one kind, in the managing of which, I have, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Attacked our enemies in their own Fortreſs</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 254.</note>, and taken this <hi>Goliah</hi> weapon out of their hands; and though the diſarming <hi>de Meaux</hi> of that, in which his whole ſtrength lies, is entirely to overcome him; yet ſince ſome of the reaſons he lays down to juſtifie his pretended Tradition, may without that, conſidered meerly by themſelves, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a ſeeming plauſibleneſs, if not real ſtrength in them to defend the Communion in one kind from thoſe <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent difficulties</hi> under which, as he owns, it labours, and which he would willingly take off from it: I ſhall in the laſt place conſider all thoſe principles and arguments from <hi>Reaſon</hi> which are laid down by him to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>His firſt principle is this: <hi>That in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments we are obliged to do not all that which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ hath done, but onely that which is eſſential to them.</hi> This we allow, and this principle, as he ſays, <hi>Is without contest:</hi> No Church, nor no Chriſtians, did ever think themſelves obliged to all thoſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> with which Chriſt celebrated the bleſſed Euchariſt at its firſt Inſtitution; and as to Baptiſm, Chriſt himſelf did not perform, but onely command that Sacrament: I cannot think that Monſieur <hi>Jurieux</hi> ſhould propoſe this for a rule, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> charges him<note n="*" place="margin">P. 349.</note>, <hi>To do univerſally all that Jeſus Christ did, in ſuch ſort, that we ſhould regard all circumſtances he obſerved, as being of abſolute neceſſity.</hi> What to do it onely at night, and after ſupper, and in an
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:36224:89"/>upper room, and the like? This could never enter into any mans head of common underſtanding, much leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſo learned a mans as Monſieur <hi>Jurieux.</hi> They who are ſo zealous for unleavened Bread, becauſe Chriſt <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably</hi> uſed it (for there are diſputes about it) at his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Supper, though if he did it was onely by accident, yet do not think fit to enquire what was the <hi>particular ſort</hi> of Wine which he bleſſed and gave his Diſciples, nor think themſelves obliged to celebrate only in <hi>that,</hi> which yet they might do with as much reaſon; and though the putting Water into the Wine, which was very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and uſed very likely by the <hi>Jews</hi> and others in thoſe hot Countrys, is not remarked in the firſt Inſtitution; yet I know none that make any great ſcruple at it: As to the poſture of receiving, which has been the moſt controverted, yet the ſtiffeſt Contenders in that, have not thought it neceſſary to keep exactly to the ſame in which Chriſt gave and the Apoſtles received at firſt, which was diſcumbency; if theſe circumſtances indeed had been commanded, as a great many of the like nature were very preciſely to the <hi>Jews</hi> in their eating the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſover, then they ought to have been obſerved in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Divine Law; but the Command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this;</hi> does not in the leaſt extend to theſe, but onely to the Sacramental Action of <hi>bleſſing Bread and eating it, bleſſing Wine and drinking it in remembrance of Chriſt:</hi> For that was the thing which Chriſt did, and which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to do; and the very ſame thing may be done with quite other circumſtances then thoſe with which he did it, with other words, for we know not what were the words with which Chriſt bleſt the Bread or the Wine; with other company, more or leſs then twelve men, in another poſture then that of lying, and in another place and time, and the like; he that does not plainly ſee thoſe to be circumſtances, and cannot eaſily diſtinguiſh them from the thing it ſelf which Chriſt did and commanded to be <pb n="99" facs="tcp:36224:89"/>done, muſt not know what it is to eat and to drink, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be with his own family, in ſuch a room of his own houſe, and at ſuch an hour of the day; 'tis certainly as eaſie to know what Chriſt inſtituted, and what he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, as to know this, and conſequently what belongs to the eſſence of the Sacrament without which it would not be ſuch a Sacrament as Chriſt celebrated and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as to know what it is to eat and to drink: and yet Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is pleaſed to make this the great difficulty,<note place="margin">P. 239, 257, 349.</note> 
                     <hi>To know what belongs to the eſſence of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and what does not, and to diſtinguiſh what is eſſential in it, from what is not.</hi> And by this means he endeavour; to darken what is as clear as the light, and ſo to avoid the plaineſt Inſtitution and the cleareſt Command: <hi>The Inſtitution,</hi> ſays he, <hi>does not ſuffice, ſince the queſtion always returns to know what appertains to the eſſence of the Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, Jeſus Christ not having diſtinguiſht them. Jeſus Chriſt inſtituted this Sacrament in the evening, at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the night in which he was to be delivered, it was at this time he would leave us his Body given for us:</hi> Does the time or the hour then belong to the Inſtitution? does this appertain to the eſſence of it? and is it not as plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and evidently a <hi>circumſtance,</hi> as night or noon is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance to eating and drinking? Does the command of Chriſt, <hi>Do this,</hi> belong to that or to the other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of doing it, when the ſame thing, the ſame Sacramental action may be done without them? is not this a plain rule to make a diſtinction between the <hi>act</hi> it ſelf, and the <hi>circumſtances</hi> of performing it? <hi>Becauſe there were a great many things done by Jeſus Christ in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which we do not believe our ſelves obliged to do:</hi> ſuch as being in an upper Room, lying upon a Bed, and the like, which are not properly things done by Chriſt, ſo much as circumſtances of doing it; for the thing done, was taking Bread and Wine, and bleſſing and diſtributing them; does therefore Chriſt's command <hi>Do this,</hi> belong <pb n="100" facs="tcp:36224:90"/>no more to eating and drinking, than it does to thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, or rather circumſtances with which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thoſe? is drinking as much a circumſtance as do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it after ſupper, if it be, eating may be ſo too? Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is aſhamed to ſay this, but yet 'tis what he aims at; for elſe the Cup will neceſſarily appear to belong to the Sacrament as an eſſential, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an indiſpenſible part of it; and this may be plainly known to be ſo from the words of Chriſt and from Scripture, without the help of Tradition; though that alſo, as I have ſhewn, does fully agree with thoſe, but they are ſo plain as not to need it in this caſe: Eating and drinking are ſo plainly the eſſential part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſo clearly diſtinguiſht from the other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in Scripture, that St.
<hi>Paul</hi> always ſpeaks of thoſe without any regard to the other:
<hi>The Bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? the Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Christ</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>? <hi>For as often as ye eat this Bread and drink this Cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death till he come</hi>

<hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, in which,</hi> he tells us, <hi>the whole World agree</hi>

                     <hi>and that this is the onely manner of Baptizing we read of the Scriptures, and that he can ſhew by the Acts of Councils, and by ancient Rituals that for thirteen hundred years the whole Church Baptized after this manner, as much as it was poſſible</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P. 171.</note>. If it be ſo, than it ſeems there is not only Scripture but <pb n="101" facs="tcp:36224:90"/>Tradition for it, which is the great principle he takes ſo much pains to eſtabliſh; And what then ſhall we have to ſay to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> to whom <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſeems to have given up that cauſe, that he may defend the other of Communion in one kind, for his aim in all this is to make immerſion as eſſential to Baptiſm, as eating and drinking to the Lord's Supper? and if Scripture and Tradition be both ſo fully for it, I know not what can be againſt it;<note place="margin">P. 299.</note> but <hi>de Meaux</hi> knows <hi>ſome Gentlemen who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer things as best pleaſes them; the preſent difficulty tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſports them, and being preſſed by the objection, they ſay at that moment what ſeems most to diſentangle them from it, without much reflecting whether it agree, I do not ſay, with truth, but with their own thoughts.</hi> The Inſtitution of the Euchariſt in Bread and Wine, and the command to do this, which belonged to both eating and drinking, lay very heavy upon him, and to eaſe himſelf of thoſe which he could not do if it were always neceſſary to obſerve what Chriſt inſtituted and commanded, he was willing to make Baptiſm by dipping to be as much command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and inſtituted as this, though it be not now obſerved as neceſſary either by thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or the Reformed; and beſides his arguments to prove that from Scripture, he makes an univerſal Tradition of the Church, which he pretends all along in his Book, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Communion in both kinds, and which is the great thing he goes upon, yet to be for this ſort of Baptiſm no leſs than 1300 years: So that neither the law in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, nor Tradition, as it explains that law, is always, it ſeems, to be obſerved, which is the thing ought openly to be ſaid for Communion in one kind: <hi>The Cauſe it ſelf demands this, and we must not expect that an errour can be defended after a conſequent manner</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Ib.</note>. But is Scripture and Tradition both for Baptiſm by immerſion? Surely not; the word Baptize, in which the command is given, ſignifies only to waſh in general, and not to plung all over, as I have

                  <p>The ſecond principle of <hi>de Meaux</hi> is, <hi>That to diſtinguiſh what appertains or does not appertain to the ſubſtance of a Sacrament; we must regard the eſſential effect of that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</hi> But muſt we regard nothing elſe? muſt we not regard the outward part as well as the inward? and does not that appertain to the ſubſtance of a Sacrament
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36224:91"/>as well as the other? I confeſs the word ſubſtance which <hi>de Meaux</hi> uſes, is equivocal and ambiguous, for it may ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie either the outward part of it as 'tis a ſacred ſign or ſymbol, and ſo the matter and form does appertain to the ſubſtance or eſſence of it, or it may ſignifie the inward grace and vertue, which is alſo of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament as 'tis the thing ſignified, and it is not onely one but both of theſe that do appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, or to ſpeak more clearly and plainly, that make it a Sacrament: If <hi>de Meaux</hi> underſtands no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe by the ſubſtance of the Sacrament but the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential effect of it, then his words are confuſed and run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and he had as good have put it thus:
<hi>That to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh what appertains or does not appertain to the eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al effect of the Sacrament, we must regard the eſſential effect of the Sacrament:</hi> Which though it had not been ſenſe, yet he had better told us his meaning by it; but ſurely there is ſomething elſe that does plainly belong to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, beſides the eſſential effect; 'tis ſtrange that <hi>de Meaux, the Treaſury of Wiſdom, the Fountain of Eloquence, the Oracle of his Age,</hi> as he is ſtiled by the Tranſlator, but who like the Oracles of old, too often
<hi>doubles</hi> and <hi>equivocates,</hi> that ſo great a man ſhould not either underſtand or conſider the plain nature of a Sacrament, ſo as to account the external and viſible part to belong to the eſſence or ſubſtance of it, as well as the internal or the eſſential effect: Does not every <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm</hi> tell us that the Sacrament is made up of theſe two parts, of the <hi>Res Terrena</hi> and <hi>Caeleſtis,</hi> as
<hi>Irenaeus</hi>

<hi>de Meaux</hi> pleaſes, of the Sacrament of Baptiſm lies in the outward waſhing the body with Water, in the <pb n="104" facs="tcp:36224:92"/>name of the Father Son and Holy Ghoſt, which is the outward form of it, without which it was declared null, as well as in the cleanſing the Soul, and we muſt regard the one as well as the other,<note n="*" place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21.</note> though St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us, <hi>It is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, whereby ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſaveth us, but the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God.</hi> Yet ſtill we are to obſerve the outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and may know by another way, namely, from the Inſtitution, that that does appertain to the ſubſtance of it; elſe with the
<hi>Quakers</hi> and <hi>Socinians,</hi> we may leave off all Sacraments, and all the poſitive and outward ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Chriſtianity, and onely regard the <hi>eſſential effect</hi> and inviſible grace of them, which they alſo pretend to have without the viſible ſign: As <hi>waſhing with water</hi> does appertain to the ſubſtance of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> ſo does
<hi>eating Bread and drinking Wine</hi> appertain to the ſubſtance of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; and we muſt regard thoſe which are the true matter of this Sacrament as well as the <hi>eſſential effect</hi> of it; elſe how were the <hi>Aquarii</hi> that uſed Water, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that uſed Milk, reproved ſo ſeverely by St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> if the keeping to the outward Elements which Chriſt has inſtituted and appointed, be not as well to be regarded as the inward and eſſential effect? and if theſe do not appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, and could not be eaſily known and diſtinguiſht from the other circumſtances of the Sacrament, by other means than by regard to the eſſential effect, which they might hope to partake of without them: <hi>De Meaux</hi> is ſo wholly taken up with the <hi>eſſential Effect,</hi> and <hi>entire Fruit,</hi> and the <hi>inſeparable Grace</hi> of the Sacrament, with which words he hopes to blind and amuſe his Reader, and therefore he drops them almoſt in half the Pages of his Book, that he takes not due care, nor is much concerned about the outward and viſible part of the Sacrament, which he knows is ſo groſly violated, and ſhamefully mangled, and mutilated in his Church, and yet this is ſo conſiderable, <pb n="105" facs="tcp:36224:92"/>that 'tis not a true Sacrament without it; and <hi>Gelaſius</hi> plainly calls the dividing of the outward part of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the dividing of the Myſtery; and to be plain with him, and to give the killing blow to his cauſe, and to all the artifical ſlights with which he fences and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends it, and as he ſpeaks, <hi>For once to ſtop the mouth of theſe Cavillers,</hi> I ſhall lay down this principle,

                        <item>1. Whether the ſame Grace, Vertue, and Benefit do not belong to one Species, or be not given by one Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies which is by both?</item>
                        <item>2. Whether one Species containing both Chriſt's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, by the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and conſequently the perſon of Chriſt whole and entire by the Doctrine of Concomitancy, do not contain and give whole Chriſt, and ſo the whole <hi>ſubſtance</hi> and thing <hi>ſignified</hi> of the Sacrament?</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">I. Whether the ſame Grace, Vertue, and Benefit be not given by one Species as by both? This <hi>de Meaux</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very-where aſſerts, and 'tis the foundation he all along goes upon; but is it not ſtrange preſumption when God has been pleaſed to appoint ſuch a Religious Rite and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental Action to be performed in ſuch a manner, with
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36224:93"/>a promiſe of ſuch graces and benefits to thoſe who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it aright, to think he will grant the ſame benefits to thoſe who perform it otherwiſe than he has appointed, and to venture to make a change and alteration from what he poſitively ordered, and yet think to partake of the ſame benefits another way, without any ſuch out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means, and without any Sacraments at all, for they are wholly in his own free diſpoſal, and he is not tied to any outward means, nor to ſuch particular means as the Sacraments are; but ſince he has thought fit to make them the ordinary means of conveying thoſe benefits to us, we cannot ordinarily hope for the one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; thus we cannot expect the vertue and benefit of Baptiſm without the outward ceremony of waſhing, and without obſerving that in ſuch a way as Chriſt has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, <hi>i. e.</hi> waſhing with Water in the name of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and Holy Ghoſt; neither can we receive the inward grace and vertue of the Euchariſt without taking <hi>that</hi> Sacrament as Chriſt hath appointed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, for all Sacraments would looſe their worth and value, their eſteem and reverence, and would not be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be obſerved according to the Divine Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if without the obſervance of <hi>that</hi> we had any juſt grounds to hope for the vertue and benefits of them; there is therefore all the reaſon in the World to fear that God to preſerve the integrity of his own Inſtitution, and the force and authority of his own Laws, will deny the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sacrament to thoſe who wilfully violate and tranſgreſs the outward obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it in ſuch a way as he has appointed: Has not Chriſt annexed the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the outward Sign? If he have, and we do not receive the outward Sign as he has appointed, how can we then hope to receive the inward Grace? What is it that makes ſuch an outward ſign or ceremony as a Sacrament, be a means of conveying ſuch ſpiritual Grace <pb n="107" facs="tcp:36224:93"/>and Vertue, and exibiting ſuch inward benefits to our minds? It is not any phyſical power, or natural vertue which they have in themſelves; it is not the waſhing with a little Water can cleanſe the Soul, or the eating a little Bread and drinking a little Wine, can nouriſh and ſtrengthen it, but it is the Divine Power of Chriſt, who by his Inſtitution has given ſuch a ſpiritual and inward vertue to ſuch outward ſigns and viſible actions, and made theſe the means and inſtruments of conveying and exhibiting ſuch grace and vertue and real benefits to us; all the power and efficacy they have to do this is owing purely to the Divine Inſtitution, and wholly depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that; if therefore we do not obſerve the Inſtitution, how can we expect the benefit that comes wholly from that, and if Chriſt by the Inſtitution has annexed the grace, and vertue, and benefit of the Sacrament to both kinds, which he has plainly done by inſtituting of both; how can we then hope to receive it by one contrary to the Inſtitution? and how can we be aſſured that we looſe nothing, and are deprived of nothing by taking one onely, and that this is as good and ſufficient as taking of both? There is nothing appears from the will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of him that inſtituted both, upon which the whole vertue of them does entirely depend, from whence we can gather any ſuch thing, it rather appears from thence that both are neceſſary, becauſe both are inſtituted; <hi>de Meaux</hi> therefore does not fetch it from thence, but from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it ſelf, from the <hi>inſeperableneſs</hi> of that grace which is given in the Sacrament, and from the
<hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility</hi> in the thing to have it otherwiſe:
<hi>Christ,</hi> ſays he, <hi>cannot ſeperate the vertue of the Sacrament, nor effect that any other grace ſhould accompany his Blood ſhed, than that ſame in the ground and ſubſtance which accompanies his Body immolated</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 182.</note>. But Chriſt can annex the vertue of the Sacrament to the whole Sacrament, and not to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of it, and he can effect that the grace of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <pb n="108" facs="tcp:36224:94"/>and Blould ſhould accompany or belong to both the eating his Body and drinking his Blood, and not to the doing one of theſe without the other, contrary to his command and inſtitution; although the grace be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, ſo that
<hi>the grace annexed to the Body be no other than that which is annexed to the Blood</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 3.</note>; yet this grace may not be given till both the Body and Blood are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expreſly ſays, <hi>it may not</hi> in the caſe of the Prieſts taking both kinds <hi>till the whole ſumption of both Species is performed and finiſhed</hi>

                     <note n="†" place="margin">P.
182.</note>: If the effect of theſe be not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till they are both received, and there be no applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effect, as we cannot be aſſured there is without the receiving of both: <hi>But did Christ then,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſuſpend the effect which his Body was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, until ſuch time as the Apoſtles had received the Bloud,</hi> in the firſt inſtitution of this Sacrament, and in the internal between their taking the Bread and the Cup? I anſwer, they did not receive the grace of the Sacrament till they had received the whole Sacrament, becauſe the grace and effect was annexed to the whole and not to any part of it; and therefore the effect may not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be ſuſpended till the whole is taken, but even utterly loſt without receiving the whole. It is a little too nice and curious to enquire what are the preciſe moments in which we receive this grace of the Sacrament, or any other ordinance as well as what is the particular manner in which we do receive it, as whether all at once or by part, or whether the effect be given in ſuch a minute, or ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="109" facs="tcp:36224:94"/>till the next? In return to <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s queſtion, I might as well ask him whether the effect of the Body is given when 'tis juſt put into the mouth? or when the ſpecies is chewed there? or when it is ſwallowed down and comes into the ſtomack? or whether it be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till all this is done? So in Baptiſm which he will needs have to be commanded by Chriſt, and anciently practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by immerſion; Was the grace of it given when part of the body was dipt, or the whole immerged? and then, whether when the body was under water, or when it was raiſed out of it? and when this was performed by Trine Immerſion, as 'tis commanded in the <hi>Apoſtolic Canons</hi>

                     </note>, was the effect of it ſuſpended till the laſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion was over? ſo in the <hi>Jews</hi> eating of their Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices whereby they were made partakers of the Altar, and had the vertue of thoſe applied to them, as we by feeding on the Chriſtian Sacrifice do partake of the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that, Was this done by the firſt bit they ate of them? or was the half the vertue applied when they had ate half? or was the whole ſuſpended till the whole was eaten? By theſe queſtions I hope <hi>de Meaux</hi> may ſee the vain ſubtilty and folly of his own, which he thinks is ſo much to the purpoſe, and does the buſineſs of proving the effect of the Sacrament to be given by one Species either before or without the other; when the effect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, beſides other things, upon the whole action, and the whole performance, and the receiving of both of them. When there is a conveyance of a thing by ſome viſible ceremony which conſiſts of ſeveral parts and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions; as ſuppoſe the conveying an Eſtate by Deed, there is to be the ſetting of a Hand, and the putting of a Seal, and the delivery of it, and ſomething given and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as Livery and Seizin, and the like; all thoſe things which the Law requires to be done as a form of paſſing and transferring of a right from one and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it by another; theſe are all to be done before the
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36224:95"/>thing is truly, and legally, and rightly conveyed: The Sacraments he knows are outward tokens, and viſible pledges, and ſolemn rites and ceremonies of Chriſt's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying and our receiving his Body and Bloud, and all the effects and benefits of them, and till all that the Law of Chriſt appoints to be done in them according to his command and inſtitution, be truly and fully perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; we do not ordinarily receive, nor can we pretend a right to thoſe things which they are deſigned to convey to us; which I think is a plain illuſtration of the thing, and takes off all the vain and nice ſubtilties of <hi>de Meaux</hi> about this matter; but yet I ſhall offer ſomething fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther concerning it.</p>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To make the whole Grace, and Vertue, and entire Fruit of the Sacrament to be given by one Species, is to render the other wholly uſeleſs and ſuperfluous as to the conveying any real vertue or benefit to him that receives it.

For they have not yet declared, that I know of, that the Prieſt is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive more grace by the Sacrament than the people: What a meer empty Cup muſt the Prieſt then receive, void of all grace and vertue, after he has taken the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread which has before given him the whole and entire fruit and grace of the Sacrament, to which the Cup can add nothing at all? It muſt be then as utterly fruitleſs to him, as the Wine of <hi>ablution</hi> is to the Laiety, and if it be ſo inconſiderable, they need not, methinks, be ſo afraid of the Laymens ſpilling it or dipping their Beards and Whiskers in it; but <hi>it is ſtill the very natural and true Blood of Christ;</hi> if it be ſo, 'tis ſtrange that it ſhould have no true and eſſential vertue belonging to it, ſurely Chriſt's Bloud is never without that, nor ought any to have ſo mean and low an opinion of it.</p>
                  <p>Why did Chriſt give the Cup to the Apoſtles, as part of the Sacrament, if they had received the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament before? and if <hi>ſo ſoon as they had received his Body, at the ſame inſtant they received the whole grace that accompanied that,</hi> and his Blood too? Chriſt if he did not <hi>ſuſpend</hi> the effect of the Blood till it was taken, muſt have <hi>prevented</hi> it, and given it before it was. Chriſt no doubt might have given the whole grace and effect of the Sacrament by one Species, if he had pleaſed; but if he had done that, he would not have given the other, nor ſhould we have had two Species In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by him, if he had reſtrained the effect of thoſe two to one onely: When Chriſt has appointed two and <pb n="114" facs="tcp:36224:97"/>gave two himſelf, for men to come and argue that one alone may give the whole good of both, becauſe <hi>the Grace of both is the ſame, and inſeparable from either, and becauſe Christ did not ſuſpend the effect of one till he gave the other, and that 'tis impoſſible he ſhould ſeparate the effect of his Bloud from that of his Body;</hi> this is to argue at all adventures againſt what is known, from what is ſecret and uncertain, againſt the plain will of Chriſt from his power, and againſt what he has done from what he might do, and is to ſet up a precarious and ungrounded Hypotheſis of our own, from the nature of the thing, when the thing itſelf is purely arbitrary and poſitive, and depends wholly upon Chriſt's will and pleaſure. If Chriſt himſelf has appointed two Species in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convey the whole and entire vertue of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to worthy receivers, as he ſeems plainly to have done by inſtituting both, and giving both to his Apoſtles, and commanding both; how groundleſs and arrogant is it in any to ſay, That one is ſufficient to give this, and that both are not neceſſary to this end; without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing further of Chriſt's will about it; and when they believe as <hi>de Meaux</hi> does,<note n="†" place="margin">P.

                     <hi>That Jeſus Christ has equally inſtituted both parts;</hi> Yet notwithſtanding to make one unneceſſary to the giving any real vertue and benefit, and to dare to affirm as <hi>de Meaux</hi> does,<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 4.</note> That <hi>the receiving the Blood is not neceſſary for the grace of the Sacrament, or the ground of the Myſtery.</hi>

                  <p>Let me then ask what it is neceſſary for, and why it was
<hi>equally</hi> inſtituted with the other? <hi>De Meaux</hi> gives not a plain anſwer to that, but tells us, That <hi>the Eucharist has another quality,</hi> namely, <hi>that of a Sacrifice</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">P.

<hi>Sacrifice,</hi> which it is not in a proper <pb n="115" facs="tcp:36224:97"/>ſence, though it be not my buſineſs to ſhew that here, but as it is a
<hi>Sacrament;</hi> Why did Chriſt inſtitute both Species in the Euchariſt, as it is a <hi>Sacrament?</hi> and why did he give both Species to his Apoſtles? He did not give theſe to them as a Sacrifice, for as ſuch, if it were ſo, it was to be onely offered up to God; but he gave both the Species to his Diſciples; and why did he do this, if the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by one? and why does the Prieſt receive both as well as offer both to God? He does not receive them as a Sacrifice, but as a Sacrament: And why is the Sumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both neceſſary to him, as the Euchariſt is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſays it is, <hi>upon that very account</hi>

If he did, and therefore two Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were neceſſary, (though if his Body and Blood be both together in one, that might be ſufficient) why need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he then to have afterwards offered up himſelf upon the Croſs, when he had as truly offered up his Body and Blood before in the Euchariſt?</p>
                  <p>If two Species are neceſſary to make a full repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt's death, and to preſerve a perfect image of his Sacrifice upon the Croſs, and by the myſtical ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Body and Blood in the Euchariſt, to repreſent how they were really ſeparated at his death; why are they not then neceſſary as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays,
<hi>They are not to the ground of the Myſtery:</hi> Is not the Euchariſt as it is a Sacrament, deſigned to do all this, and to be ſuch a
<hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christ,</hi> and <hi>a ſhewing forth the Lord's death
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36224:98"/>till he come;</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks? And do not they in great meaſure deſtroy this, by giving the Sacrament in one kind, without this myſtical ſeparation of Chriſt's Body and Blood; and without preſerving ſuch a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Repreſentation of it as Chriſt has appointed?

                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P.

This I confeſs, for then the eating the Fleſh and drinking the Bloud of a man, as ſome <hi>Heretics</hi> did of an Infant, might more exactly repreſent than Bread and Wine; but ſuch a repreſentation as Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has appointed and commanded, this is requiſite: and when he can prove that Chriſt has commanded Immer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in Baptiſm to repreſent the cleanſing of the Soul, as he has done taking Bread broken and Wine poured out in the Euchariſt, to repreſent his Death, I will own that to be requiſite in anſwer to his §. 11. There ought to be alſo an expreſſion of the grace of the Sacrament, which is not found in one Species alone, for that is not a full expreſſion of our perfect nouriſhment both by meat and drink; and if the Sacraments onely exhibit what they repreſent, which is an Axiom of the School-men; then as one kind repreſents our ſpiritual nouriſhment im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly, ſo it exhibits it imperfectly; but however, if the whole grace and vertue of the Sacrament be given by one Species, the other muſt be wholly ſuperfluous and unneceſſary as to the inward effect, and ſo at moſt it muſt be but a meer ſignificant ſign, void of all grace, as <hi>de Meaux</hi> indeed makes it, though the name of a ſign, as applied to the Sacrament, is ſo hard to go down with them at other times, when he ſays of the ſpecies of Wine, <hi>That the whole fruit of the Sacrament is given without it, and that this can adde nothing thereunto, but onely a more full expreſſion of the ſame Myſtery</hi>

                  <p n="2">II. The ſecond queſtion I propoſed to conſider, was, Whether one Species containing both Chriſt's Body and Blood by the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently <pb n="117" facs="tcp:36224:98"/>the perſon of Chriſt whole and entire by the Doctrine of Concomitancy, do not contain and give whole Chriſt, and ſo the whole ſubſtance and thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified of the Sacrament?

                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 327.</note>, according to theſe Principles of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. I am not here to diſpute againſt thoſe, nor to ſhew the falſeneſs and unreaſonableneſs of that which is the ground of them, and which if it be falſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys all the reſt, I mean <hi>Tranſubſtantiation,</hi> whereby they ſuppoſe the Bread to be turn'd into the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body of Chriſt, with Fleſh, Bones, Nerves, and all other parts belonging to it, and the Wine to be turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the very natural ſubſtance of his Bloud; and ſince this Fleſh is not a dead Fleſh, it muſt have the Blood joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and even the very Soul and Divinity of Chriſt, which is always Hypoſtatically united to it, and ſo does neceſſarily accompany it; and the Body with Chriſt's Soul and Divinity, muſt thus likewiſe ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company his Blood: To which prodigious Doctrine of theirs as it relates to the Communion in one kind, I have theſe things to ſay:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It does ſo confound the two Species, and make them to be one and the ſame thing, that it renders the diſtinct conſecration of them to be not onely imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent but ſenceleſs; For to what purpoſe, or with what ſenſe can the words of Conſecration be ſaid over the Bread, <hi>This is my Body?</hi> and thoſe again over the Wine, <hi>This is my Blood:</hi> If upon the ſaying of them by the Prieſt the Bread does immediately become both the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <pb n="118" facs="tcp:36224:99"/>and Blood of Chriſt, and the Wine both his Blood and his Body too; this is to make the Bread become the ſame thing with the Wine, and the Wine the ſame thing with the Bread, and to make onely the ſame thing twice over, and to do that again with one form of words which was done before with another; for upon repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> Chriſt's Body and Blood are both of them immediately and truly preſent; and when they are ſo, what need is there of the other form, <hi>This is my Blood,</hi> to make the ſame thing preſent again, which was truly preſent before? It matters not at all in this caſe, whether they be preſent by vertue of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration, or by vertue of Concomitancy, for if they be truly preſent once, what need they be preſent again, if they become the ſame thing after the firſt form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration which they do after the ſecond? why do they become the ſame thing twice? or what need is there of another form of words to make the Wine become that which the Bread was before? they hold it indeed to be Sacriledge not to conſecrate both the Species, but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee according to this principle of theirs, why the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating of one Species ſhould not be ſufficient, when upon the conſecration of that, it immediately becomes both Chriſt's Body and Blood; and what reaſon is there for making the ſame Body and Blood over again by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother conſecration? They might if they pleaſed ſay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Bread alone, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum, &amp; hoc est ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis meus; This is my Body, and this is my Bloud:</hi> for they believe it is ſo upon the ſaying thoſe words, <hi>Hoc est Corpus meum; This is my Body</hi> And if it be ſo as ſoon as the words are pronounced, they may as truly affirm it to be both as one: What does it ſignifie to ſay, they are both preſent by Concomitancy? does not Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy always go along with the Conſecration? is there any ſpace between the Conſecration and the Concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy? is not the one as quick and ſudden as the other?
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36224:99"/>and can it be ſaid over the Species of Bread, <hi>This is my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> before it can be as truly ſaid, <hi>This is my Blood?</hi> why therefore may not they be both ſaid together? Nay, it may be as truly ſaid by vertue of this Doctrine not only, This is my Body and Blood, but this is my Soul and my Divinity; for though they will not ſay it is <hi>made</hi> all thoſe, yet it <hi>becomes</hi> all thoſe, and truly <hi>is</hi> all thoſe by this Concomitancy upon the Conſecration, and it may be ſaid to
<hi>be</hi> all thoſe as ſoon as it is conſecrated, and at the ſame time that thoſe words are ſpoke.</p>
                  <p>There being a diſtinct Conſecration of Chriſt's Body and Bloud in the Sacrament, if Chriſt's Body and Bloud be really preſent there by vertue of the words of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, yet they ought to be as diſtinctly preſent as they are diſtinctly conſecrated, that is, the Body preſent in the ſpecies of Bread, and the Blood in the ſpecies of Wine, for elſe they are not preſent according to the Conſecration; ſo that this Concomitancy by which they are preſent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, does quite ſpoile the Conſecration by which they are preſent aſunder, and ſo confounds the two Species as to make them become both the ſame thing after they are conſecrated, and renders the conſecration of one of them to be without either uſe or ſenſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It makes the diſtinct Sumption of both the Species to be vain and unneceſſary to any perſons, to the Prieſts or to any others to whom the Pope has ſometimes gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and even to the Apoſtles and all the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who received both; for if the one contains the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing with the other, and gives the very ſame thing, what need is there of having or of taking both, that is, of taking the very ſame thing twice over at the ſame time? If one Species contain Jeſus Chriſt whole and entire, his Body, Bloud, Soul, and Divinity, and all theſe are given by one Species, what can be deſired more as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, Then Jeſus Chriſt himſelf? and what then can the other Species give but the ſame thing? is <pb n="120" facs="tcp:36224:100"/>Jeſus Chriſt with whole Humanity and Divinity to be thus taken over and over, and to be taken twice at the ſame time? if he be, why not ſeveral times more, and if he were ſo, this might be done by taking ſeveral times the ſame Species, ſince one Species contains the ſame as both, even the whole ſubſtance, and the whole eſſential effect of the Sacrament, and the very perſon of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. This does ſo alter the nature of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by which we have a continual nouriſhment conveyed to our Souls, and receive the Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt by freſh and daily recruits, and in ſeveral meaſures and degrees every time we Communicate, that it makes it not onely to no purpoſe for any perſon to take more than one Species at once, but to take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament more than once all his whole life, for what need he deſire more, who has received <hi>together with the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Jeſus Chriſt, his Divinity alſo whole and entire</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 314.</note>, and if he has received that once, there is no reaſon for receiving it again, for this as it renders the Grace and Subſtance of the Sacrament <hi>Indiviſible,</hi> as <hi>de Meaux</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten pleades, ſo it renders it <hi>Infinite,</hi> to which nothing can be ever added by receiving it never ſo often; and if we thus make this Sacrament to give the very Body and Bloud of Chriſt, and ſo the whole and entire Perſon of Chriſt, and his whole Humanity and his whole Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, inſtead of giving the ſpiritual <hi>Graces</hi> and <hi>Vertues</hi> of Chriſt's Body and Bloud, we then make every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant to receive all that by one ſingle Communion which he can ever receive by never ſo many thouſands, and we make all perſons to receive this alike, however different the preparations and diſpoſitions of their minds are, and even the moſt wicked and vile wretches muſt receive, not onely Chriſt's Body and Blood, but even his Soul, and his Divinity, and his whole and entire Perſon; for though the ſpiritual graces and vertues may be given in different meaſures and degrees, and in different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions <pb n="121" facs="tcp:36224:100"/>according to the capacity of the receiver, yet the Humanity and Divinity of Chriſt, which is whole and entire in each Species, never can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If Chriſt's Body and Bloud were thus always joyned together in the Sacrament, and were both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in one Species, yet this would not be a true <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental</hi> reception of them, for to make <hi>that,</hi> they ought to be taken as ſeparate and divided from one another, his Body from his Blood, and his Bloud from his Body, and not as conjoyned or mixt together; this was the way and manner which Chriſt himſelf appointed, and this is the onely way by which we can be ſaid to eat his Body and to drink his Blood: and as they own they ought to be thus conſecrated, ſo they ought alſo to be thus received, for I cannot underſtand why they might not be as well conſecrated together as received together, and why it would not be as true a Sacrament with ſuch a
<hi>Conſecration</hi> as with ſuch a <hi>Sumption;</hi> nay, I think the Conſecration this way would have more ſenſe in it than the Sumption, for it is nothing ſo odd and ſtrange to ſuppoſe the Bread to be turned into the Body and Bloud of Chriſt, as to ſuppoſe that by eating <hi>that</hi> we both eat the Body and drink the Blood of Chriſt; to make eating and drinking the ſame thing, or to ſay we <hi>drink</hi> by <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>eat</hi> by <hi>drinking,</hi> are very unaccountable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible expreſſions, ſo that Concomitancy does whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confound thoſe two Sacramental Phraſes and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Actions: <hi>But is it not enough,</hi> ſays <hi>de Meaux</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">P.
323.</note>, <hi>for a Chriſtian to receive Jeſus Christ? is it not a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where Jeſus Christ is pleaſed to be in perſon?</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt is not received in the Sacrament in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner but by receiving his Body and Bloud, nor is it his Perſon he bids us receive, but his Body and Bloud, and the way by which we are to receive them is by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one and drinking the other, and we cannot be properly ſaid to do that, or to receive Chriſt or his <pb n="122" facs="tcp:36224:101"/>Body and Blood Sacramentally, but this way: Though the Body and Blood of Chriſt, therefore ſhould be both in one Species and both received by one Species, yet this would not be the eating the Body and the drinking the Blood, for as one of their own Popes,
<hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, ſays, and <hi>Durandus</hi> from him,
<hi>Neither is the Blood drunk under the Species of Bread, nor the Body eaten under the Species of Wine, for as the Blood is not eaten nor the Body drank, ſo neither is drunk under the Species of Bread nor eat under the Species of Wine</hi>

                     </note>. And therefore though they ſhould be both received according to them by one Species, yet they would not be both eat and drank, that is received Sacramentally; eating and drinking are diſtinct things, and both belong to the Sacrament; and though eating and drinking ſpiritually be as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, The ſame thing<note n="†" place="margin">P.
184.</note>, and <hi>both the one and the other is to believe:</hi> Yet eating and drinking Sacramentally are not, but are to be two diſtinct outward actions that are to go along in the Sacrament with our inward Faith.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of Concomitancy and of receiving the Body and Blood of Chriſt together in that groſs manner which is believed in the
<hi>Roman</hi> Church, does quite ſpoile the Sacramental reception of Chriſt's Body and Bloud, for according to <hi>that,</hi> they can never be received <hi>ſeparate</hi> and <hi>apart,</hi> no not by the two Species, but they muſt be always received <hi>together</hi> in either of them; ſo that though by the Inſtitution the Species of Bread ſeems par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to contain, or rather give the Body, and the Species of Wine the Bloud, and as St.
<hi>Paul</hi> ſays<note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor. 10.16.</note>,
<hi>The bread which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? and the cup which we bleſs, is it not the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the blood of Christ?</hi> Yet hereby <hi>either</hi> of them is made the Communion of both, and it is made impoſſible to receive them aſunder, as Chriſt inſtituted and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="123" facs="tcp:36224:101"/>and as is plainly implied by eating and drinking, and ſeems to be the very nature of a Sacramental reception: But</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This Concomitancy makes us to receive Chriſt's Body and Bloud not as ſacrificed and ſhed for us upon the Croſs, but as they are now living and both joyned together in Heaven, whereas Chriſt's Body and Bloud is given in the Sacrament, not as in the <hi>ſtate of life</hi> and glory, but as under the <hi>ſtate of death,</hi> for ſo he tells us, <hi>This is my body which is given for you,</hi> that is, to God as a Sacrifice and Oblation, and, <hi>This is my blood which is ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> So that we are to take Chriſt's Body in the Sacrament as it was crucified for us and offered up upon the Croſs, and his Bloud as it was ſhed and poured out, not as joyned with his Body, but as ſeparated from it: the Vertue of Chriſt's Body and Bloud cometh from his Death and from its being a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which was ſlain, and whoſe Blood was poured out for to make expiation for our Sins, and as ſuch we are to take Chriſt's Body and Bloud, that is, the vertue and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of them in the Sacrament, for as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">P.
311.</note> 
                     <hi>This Body and this Blood with which he nouriſheth and quickneth us, would not have the vertue if they had not been once actually ſeparated, and if this ſeparation had not cauſed the violent Death of our Saviour, by which he became our Victim.</hi> So neither will it have that vertue in the Sacrament if the Body be not taken as broken and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed, and the Bloud as ſhed or poured out, and both as ſeparated from one another: <hi>De Meaux</hi> owns, <hi>We ought to have our living Victim under an image of Death, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhould not be enlivened</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 312.</note>. I do not well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the meaning of a <hi>living Victim,</hi> for though Chriſt who was our Victim is alive, yet he was a Victim onely as he died; ſo that a living Victim is perhaps as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper a phraſe as a dead Animal. If we are to receive Chriſt then in the Sacrament as a Victim or Sacrifice, <pb n="124" facs="tcp:36224:102"/>we are to receive him not as living but as dead; I would not have <hi>de Meaux</hi> or any elſe miſtake me, as if I aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we received a dead Body,
<hi>a dead fleſh, a carcaſe</hi> as he calls it<note n="‖" place="margin">P. 309.</note> in the Sacrament, for he knows we do not believe that we receive any real fleſh, or any proper natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body at all, but onely the myſtical or ſacramental Body of Chriſt, or to ſpeak plainer, the true and real Vertue of Chriſt's Body and Bloud offered for us, and <hi>we are</hi> not onely <hi>to have this under an image of death,</hi> that is, to have the two Species ſet before us to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but we are to receive it under this image, and to eat the Body as broken, and the Bloud as poured out, and ſo to partake of Chriſt's death in the very partaking of the Sacrament;
<hi>de Meaux</hi> ſpeaks very well, when he ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">P. 312.</note> 
                     <hi>The Vertue of Christ's Body and his Blood coming from his Death, he would conſerve the image of his Death when he gave us them in his holy Supper, and by ſo lively a repreſentation keep us always in mind to the cauſe of our Salvation, that is to ſay, the Sacrifice of the Croſs.</hi> But how is this image of his Death conſerved in his holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, if Chriſt be there given not as dead but living, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy does rather mind us of Chriſt's Reſurrection when his Body was made alive again and reunited to his Soul and to his Divinity, than of his death when it was divided and ſeparated from them; and it makes us not to partake of Chriſt's Body as crucified upon the Croſs, but as glorified in Heaven; as it is ſo indeed Chriſt's body cannot be divided from his bloud, and his whole humanity, ſoul, and body are always united with his Divinity, but we do not take it as ſuch in the Sacrament, but as his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was ſacrificed, and ſlain, and wounded, and his bloud as ſhed and ſeparated from it.</p>
                  <p>They who can think of a crucified Saviour, may think of receiving him thus in the Sacrament <hi>without hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour; de Meaux</hi> owns, That this myſtical ſeparation of Chriſt's body and bloud ought to be in the Euchariſt as <pb n="125" facs="tcp:36224:102"/>it is a Sacrifice<note n="†" place="margin">P. 180, 181.</note>: And why not then as it is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? is there any more horror to have Chriſt's body thus conſecrated, then thus eaten and received? <hi>The words of conſecration,</hi> he ſays, <hi>do renew myſtically, as by a ſpiritual Sword, together with all the wounds he received in his body, the total effuſion of his blood</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Ib.</note>. Why may we not then receive Chriſt's body as thus wounded, and his bloud as thus poured out, in this myſtical Table? and why muſt Concomitancy joyn thoſe together which Conſecration has thus ſeparated and divided? Chriſt's body and bloud we ſay ought to be thus myſtically ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Sacramental reception of them, and ſo ought to be taken ſeparately and diſtinctly; they own they ought to be thus myſtically ſeparated in the conſecration, though how that conſiſts with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitancy is hard to underſtand, but whatever they have to ſay againſt the ſeparating them in the <hi>Reception,</hi> may be as well ſaid againſt their ſeparating them in the <hi>Conſecration; Is Christ then divided?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">P. 310.</note> 
                     <hi>is his body then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of bloud? and blood actually ſeparated from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy? ought Christ to die often, and often to ſhed his blood? A thing unworthy the glorious ſtate of his Reſurrection, where he ought to conſerve eternally humane nature as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire as he had at first aſſumed it.</hi> Why do they then make this ſeparation of his body and bloud when they conſecrate it? if that be onely myſtical and repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſo is it in our reception much better, for we do not pretend to receive Chriſt's natural body and bloud, as they do to conſecrate them, but onely his myſtical body and bloud, which is always <hi>to conſerve this figure of Death, and the character of a Victim,</hi> not onely when it is conſecrated, but when it is eaten and drunk, which it cannot otherwiſe be. 'Tis this errour of receiving Chriſt's natural body in the Sacrament which has led men into all thoſe dark Mazes and Labyrinths wherein they have bewildred and entangled themſelves in this <pb n="126" facs="tcp:36224:103"/>matter, and ſo by applying all the properties of Chriſt's natural body to his myſtical body in the Sacrament, they have run themſelves into endleſs difficulties, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the very notion as well as the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The third Principle of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> is this:
<hi>That the Law ought to be explained by conſtant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual practice.</hi> But cannot then a Law of God be ſo plain and clear as to be very well known and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by all thoſe to whom it is given, without being thus explained? Surely ſo wiſe a Law-Giver as our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, would not give a Law to all Chriſtians that was not eaſie to be underſtood by them; it cannot be ſaid without great reflection upon his infinite Wiſdom, that his Laws are ſo obſcure and dark as they are deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by himſelf, and as they are neceſſary to be obſerved by us, that we cannot know the meaning of them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a further explication: If conſtant and perpetual practice be neceſſary to explain the Law, how could they know it or underſtand it to whom it was firſt given, and who were firſt to obſerve it before there was any ſuch practice to explain it by? This practice muſt begin ſome where, and the Law of Chriſt muſt be known to thoſe who begun it, antecedent to their own practice: There may be great danger if we make <hi>Practice</hi> to be the <hi>Rule</hi> of the
<hi>Law,</hi> and not the <hi>Law</hi> the <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Practice,</hi> and God's Laws may be very fairly explained away, if they are left wholly to the mercy of men to explain them: For thus it was the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who were the great men of old for Tradition, did thereby <hi>reject and lay aſide</hi> the Commandment of God by making Tradition ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it contrary to its true ſenſe and meaning. This Principle therefore of Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s muſt not be admitted without ſome caution, and though we are well aſſured of conſtant and perpetual practice for Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in one kind, yet the Law of Chriſt is ſo clear as not <pb n="127" facs="tcp:36224:103"/>to need <hi>that</hi> to explain it, and we may <hi>know what apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or does not appertain to the ſubſtance of the Sacraments</hi> from the <hi>Law</hi> it ſelf, and from the divine Inſtitution of them, as I have all along ſhewn in this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>It would have been a great reflection upon the Church, if its Practice had not agreed with the Law of Chriſt, though ſo plain and expreſs a Law ought neither to looſe its force nor its meaning by any ſubſequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; I have ſo great a regard and honour for the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic Church, that I do not believe it can be guilty of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Practice ſo contrary to the Law of Chriſt, as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in one kind; and I have therefore fully ſhewn, that its Practice has always agreed with this Law, in oppoſition to <hi>de Meaux,</hi> who falſely reproaches the Church with a practice contrary to it; his deſign was to deſtroy the Law of Chriſt by the Practice of the Church; mine is to defend the Practice of the Church as agreeable to, and founded upon the Law of Chriſt, but the Law of Chriſt ought to take place, and is antecedent both to the Churches Practice and the Churches Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: As to Tradition, which was the main thing which <hi>de Meaux</hi> appealed to, I have joyned iſſue with him in that point, and muſt leave it to thoſe who are able to judge which of us have given in the better evidence, and I do not doubt but we may venture the Cauſe upon the ſtrength of <hi>that;</hi> but there is another more conſiderable
<hi>plea,</hi> which is prior to Tradition, and which as <hi>de Meaux</hi> owns,<note n="†" place="margin">P. 201.</note> 
                     <hi>Is the neceſſary ground work</hi> of it, and that is Scripture, or the Command and Inſtitution of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in Scripture, which is ſo plain and manifeſt, that it may be very well underſtood by all without the help of Tradition; I do not therefore make any manner of exceptions to Tradition in this caſe, onely I would ſet it in its right place, and not found the Law of Chriſt upon Tradition, but Tradition upon the Law of Chriſt, and I am willing to admit it as far as <hi>de Meaux</hi> pleaſes, with <pb n="128" facs="tcp:36224:104"/>this reaſonable <hi>Proviſo,</hi> That it does not interprete us out of a plain Law, nor make void any Command of God that may be known without it; I have therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented <hi>de Meaux</hi> in all he brings for Tradition and the Practice of the Church, unleſs he will lay ſo great ſtreſs upon that, as to make it null, and ſuperſede a divine Law; nor am I at all concerned in all the inſtances he brings for it out of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">§ V. §.

It was boldly and openly done indeed by the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> when it owned, <hi>That Christ inſtituted the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and adminiſtred it to his Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds</hi>

                     <hi>and that the faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it under both kinds in the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church:</hi> Yet to command it under one by its own power and authority, and by its own Prerogative to give a
<hi>Non obſtante</hi> to Chriſt's Inſtitution; this was done like thoſe that had a ſufficient <hi>plenitude</hi> of power, and were reſolved to let the World ſee they had ſo, and that Chriſt's own Inſtitution was to give way to it; they had not then found out the more ſly and ſhift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubtilties that Chriſt gave the Cup to his Diſciples onely as Prieſts, and made them Prieſts juſt after the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them the Bread; this was a late invention found out ſince that <hi>Council,</hi> by ſome more timerous and wary So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſters who were afraid of ſetting up the Churches Power againſt a Divine Inſtitution; neither did they then offer to juſtifie the Communion in one kind by the Tradition and Practice of the Primitive Church, as
<hi>de Meaux</hi> and others have done ſince, but they plainly gave
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:36224:104"/>up this, and onely made a late Cuſtom, which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards introduced, to become a Law by vertue of their preſent Power,
<hi>notwithſtanding</hi> the Inſtitution of Chriſt and the Practice of the Primitive Church to the contrary: Here the Caſe truly lies, though <hi>de Meaux</hi> is willing to go off from it, there muſt be a power in the Church to void a Divine Inſtitution, and to null a Law of Chriſt, which can be no other than an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian power in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, which may by the ſame reaſon take away all the poſitive Laws of Chriſtianity, or elſe Communion in one kind is not to be maintained; and this power muſt be in a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preſent Church, in oppoſition to the Primitive and the Univerſal, or elſe this Communion is not to be maintained in the Church of
<hi>Rome: De Meaux</hi> muſt be driven to defend that <hi>post</hi> which he ſeems to have quitted and deſerted, or elſe he can never defend this half-Communion, which is contrary, as I have proved, and as the Council of
<hi>Conſtance</hi> owns, to the Inſtitution of Chriſt, and to the Practice of the Primitive Church. The new Out-work he has raiſed from Tradition, in which he puts all the forces of his Book, and the main ſtrength of his Cauſe; this I have not beat down or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but taken from him; and his cauſe can never hold out upon his own principles of Tradition and the Practice of the Church, which is a very ſtrong batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt it, as I have largely ſhewn; ſo that all that he ſays for Tradition is in vain, and to no purpoſe, ſince this Tradition he pleades for is utterly againſt him, and if it were never ſo much for him, yet no Tradition can take away a Divine Law.</p>
                  <p>He ſeems to own, and I think he dare not expreſly deny, that what is <hi>eſſential</hi> to the Sacraments, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the ſubſtance of them cannot be taken away by <hi>Tradition</hi> or the Power of the Church, but he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly deſtroys this by making onely
<hi>Tradition</hi> and the <pb n="130" facs="tcp:36224:105"/>
                     <hi>Practice of the Church</hi> to determine what is thus eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the Sacraments, for if nothing be <hi>eſſential</hi> but what is made ſo by <hi>them,</hi> and may be known by <hi>them,</hi> then they have a power to make or to alter even the very <hi>eſſentials</hi> of the Sacraments, which are hereby made wholly to depend upon the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> We are willing to own that nothing is unalterable in the Sacraments, but what is eſſential to them, and that all other <hi>indifferent</hi> things belonging to them, may be altered by the <hi>Church,</hi> or by <hi>Tradition;</hi> but then we ſay that what is <hi>eſſential</hi> is fixt and known by the
<hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and by a <hi>Divine Law,</hi> antecedent to
<hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and if it were not ſo, then there were nothing
<hi>eſſential</hi> in the Sacraments at all, but all would be
<hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different,</hi> and all would depend upon <hi>Tradition</hi> and the
<hi>Churches Power;</hi> and then to what purpoſe is it to ſay, That the Church has power onely in the <hi>Accidentals,</hi> and may alter whatever is not <hi>eſſential,</hi> or belongs not to the ſubſtance of the Sacraments; this onely ſhews that they are aſhamed to ſpeak out, and they dare not but grant with one hand, that which they are forced to take away with another; they dare not openly ſay, That the Church has power over the eſſentials of the Sacraments; but yet they ſay, That there are no eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentials but what are made and declared to be ſo by the Church: So the ſtreight they are in obliges them in effect to revoke their own conceſſions, and Truth makes them ſay that which their Cauſe forces them to unſay again, and they are put upon thoſe things in their own neceſſary defence, which amount in the whole to a contradiction.</p>
                  <p>If the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> can ſhew us that any Divine Inſtitution was ever altered by the Jewiſh or Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Church, or any Law of God relating to Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice and Ceremony was ever taken away by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Practice and Tradition, then he ſays ſomething
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:36224:105"/>to the purpoſe, of <hi>Communion in one kind,</hi> but if the many Inſtances which he brings for Tradition out of the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> do none of them do this, they are then uſeleſs and inſufficient, they fall ſhort of what they ought to prove, and come not up to the queſtion in hand, but are wholly vain and inſignificant, and to ſhew they are ſo, I ſhall reduce them to theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing heads:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They chiefly relate to the Churches Power in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing and determining ſeveral things which are left indifferent and undetermined by the Law of God; and here we acknowledge the Church to have a proper Power, and that it may oblige even in Conſcience to many things, to which we are not obliged by the Law of God; and may determine many things for the ſake of Peace and Uniformity in Divine Worſhip, which are not ſo preciſely determined by God himſelf. Thus the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church might ſettle the time of <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers,</hi> on which their Sabbaths and Feaſts were to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, the evening being to them the beginning of the next day; ſo they might appoint alſo the manner of obſerving the new Moons; thus they might alſo ſettle the times of the Three Sacrifices, the
<hi>Daily,</hi> the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batical,</hi> and the <hi>Paſchal,</hi> when they were all to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the ſame day upon one Altar; and determine which of them ſhould be offered firſt, though God himſelf had not determined it: But could they take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way any one of theſe Sacrifices which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, upon a pretence that the other were ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent without it? could they have neglected either the New Moons or the Evening-Oblations which God had appointed, becauſe they might appoint what God had not done, namely, the manner of obſerving them? becauſe they could regulate ſeveral things relating to the Law, and neceſſary to the obſervance of it, which God had not determined; could they therefore void <pb n="132" facs="tcp:36224:106"/>the Law it ſelf, or tranſgreſs and violate it in any of thoſe things which God had particularly appointed? Thus the Chriſtian Church may order many things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to Divine Worſhip, and even to the Sacraments themſelves, which no Law of Chriſt has ordered or determined, as the time, the place, the outward form and manner of adminiſtring them; and yet theſe as <hi>de Meaux</hi> ſays, <hi>Are abſolutely neceſſary for the obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Divine Law;</hi> which cannot be obſerved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome of thoſe circumſtances; thus as to Baptiſm it may appoint it to be performed by ſprinkling or dipping, becauſe neither of thoſe are commanded by the word
<hi>Baptize,</hi> but onely waſhing with Water, as I have ſhewn before againſt <hi>de Meaux,</hi> but to do this in the Name of the <hi>Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</hi> is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, becauſe this is commanded, though whether with that form, <hi>I baptize thee,</hi> or <hi>Be thou ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſed;</hi> which is uſed in the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, is indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Thus as to the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the Church may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it to be taken kneeling or ſtanding, which was an ancient poſture of receiving it; it may uſe ſuch a form of words in the conſecrating the Elements, and in bleſſing the Bread and Wine, or another, for it is plain, one was not always uſed, and St. <hi>Gregory</hi> tells us, <hi>That the Apoſtles conſecrated onely with Lord's Prayer</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>63.</hi> ad Syr.</note>. It may uſe ſuch a ſort of Bread and Wine, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for no particular ſort is commanded; but it is neceſſary to bleſs and to give <hi>both,</hi> becauſe <hi>both</hi> are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and both are commanded; and the Miniſters, <hi>who are the Stewards of the Myſteries of God</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">1 Cor.
4.1.</note>, theſe alone have the ordinary power of bleſſing and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting them to the people, but they may do this by the hands of the Deacons, or by ſuffering the people to take them and divide them among themſelves: Such things as theſe which <hi>de Meaux</hi> offers to us as great difficulties, are onely indifferent things left undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:36224:106"/>by the Divine Law, in which the Church has a power to appoint what it thinks moſt proper for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and order, and edification, and thus the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt knots with which he deſigned to entangle us are eaſily reſolved and untied, and yet not any one of the Divine Laws are in the leaſt looſened or diſſolved. One of the greateſt things he urges for the neceſſity of Tradition and the Practice of the Church, is the Baptiſm of Infants, for which he ſays we can produce nothing from Scripture, but muſt be forced to reſolve it wholly into Tradition; as to
<hi>that</hi> I am not willing to begin another Controveſie with him here, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall onely ſend him to <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for his ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, who proves Infant Baptiſm from Scripture<note n="*" place="margin">Bellarmin. de Sacram. Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi. <hi>c. 8, 9.</hi>
                     </note> as well as from Tradition, and ſays, <hi>It may be clearly gathered from Scripture it ſelf</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Tamen id &amp; colligitur ſatis a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertè ex Scripturis.</note>. But if it were not, does it follow becauſe the Church may make a Law which is not contained in Scripture, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it may break a Law which is? and becauſe it may appoint ſome things which God has left indifferent, that therefore it may forbid what he has abſolutely commanded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Other inſtances produced by <hi>de Meaux,</hi> relate not onely to matters Eccleſiaſtical, but to thoſe that were Civil, or at leaſt mixt, and ſo belonging to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Magiſtrate, as the <hi>Lex Talionis,</hi> and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition of Marriage with the
<hi>Moabites</hi> and <hi>Ammo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites:</hi> The Civil Magiſtrate was to ſee all poſſible Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice done by the one, according to God's own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; and it was a commendable act in him to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all miſchief that might have come by the other, though this was done without a Divine Precept, by a general Power veſted in the Magiſtrate, or a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and immediate direction, perhaps given by God to <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> But how theſe can any way <pb n="134" facs="tcp:36224:107"/>ſerve <hi>de Meaux,</hi> I cannot imagine, in the preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, unleſs he would prove the Magiſtrate not bound to execute the <hi>Lex Talionis</hi> at all, or that the
<hi>Jews</hi> might have diſpenſed with the Law in <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy,</hi> which forbad Marriages with the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> becauſe upon the ſame ground and reaſon they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad thoſe alſo with the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and
<hi>Moabites</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Some caſes he mentions were excuſed upon the account of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> which when it is notorious and unavoidable, diſpences with a poſitive Law. Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s eating the Shewbread, which it was not lawful but for the Prieſts ordinarily to eat, is approved by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.4. not upon the account of Tradition, or the judgement of the High-Prieſt, but the extream hunger which he and his Companions were then preſſed with, and which made it lawful for them them to eat of the hallowed Bread, when there was no other to be procured: But did this make it lawful afterwards for the High-Prieſt or the Sanhedrim to have made the holy Bread always common to others when there was no ſuch neceſſity? Thus if ſome Chriſtians lived in a Country where it was impoſſible to have any Wine, this might excuſe them from taking the Cup, but does this juſtifie the making a general Law to take away the Cup when there is no ſuch neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for it? and the ſame may be ſaid of many other like inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In other caſes when a Law was founded upon a particular reaſon, the ceaſing of that made the Law to ceaſe, which was wholly grounded upon it, as in the prohibition of eating Bloud, and things ſtrangled, and Meats offered to Idols, this being to avoid giving any ſcandal to the <hi>Jews</hi> at that time, when the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it ceaſed, ſo did the Law; and it is not ſo much Tradition which makes it void, as thoſe general ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings <pb n="135" facs="tcp:36224:107"/>of Chriſt and the Apoſtle, that <hi>nothing which enters in at the mouth defiles the man;</hi> and
<hi>that whatever is ſold in the ſhambles may be eat, without asking any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion for conſcience ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Jews</hi> defending themſelves upon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, on which they were commanded ſo ſtrictly to reſt, it was both
<hi>neceſſity</hi> and the <hi>reaſon</hi> of the Law which made this juſtifiable, and not any Tradition or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſentence of the
<hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> and our Saviour when he blames their ſuperſtitious obſervance of the Sabbath, does not reprove them for keeping it as it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, or otherwiſe than Tradition had explained it, but contrary to the true reaſon and meaning of it, and to the true mind and will of the Lawgiver.</p>
                  <p>As to the Chriſtians changing the Sabbath into the firſt Day of the Week, this was not done by <hi>Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but by the
<hi>Apoſtolical Authority;</hi> and whatever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation there may be antecedent to the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> for obſerving one day in ſeven, it can neither be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved exactly the Seventh day from the Creation, much leſs that the Chriſtians are under any ſuch obligation now, or I may adde, if they were, that Tradition would excuſe them from a Divine Law.</p>
                  <p>All the inſtances which Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> heaps up, are very ſhort of proving that, and though I have examined every one of them, except that pretended <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Tradition of Praying for the Dead, which is both falſe and to no purpoſe, yet it was not becauſe there was any ſtrength in them to the maintaining his ſinking Cauſe, but that I might take away every ſlender <hi>prop</hi> by which he endeavours in vain to keep it up, and drive him out of every little <hi>hole</hi> in which he ſtrives with ſo much labour to <hi>Earth</hi> himſelf, when after all his
<hi>turnings</hi> and <hi>windings</hi> he finds he muſt be run down.</p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:36224:108"/>
                  <p>If any inſtance could be found by <hi>de Meaux</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of any Tradition, or any Practice of a Church contrary to a Divine Inſtitution, and to a plain Law of God, they would deſerve no other anſwer to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to it, but what Chriſt gave to the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> in the like caſe: <hi>Why do ye tranſgreſs the commandment of God by your tradition</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Mar.
15.3.</note>? Our Saviour did not put the matter upon this iſſue, Whether the Tradition by which they <hi>explained</hi> the Law, ſo <hi>as to make it of none effect,</hi> was truly ancient and authentic, and deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to them from their fore-Fathers; but he thought it ſufficient to tell them that it
<hi>made void,</hi> and was contrary to a Divine Law.</p>
                  <p>There is no Tradition, nor no Church, which has e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver broke ſo plain a Law, and ſo ſhamefully violated a Divine Inſtitution, as that which has ſet up Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in One Kind: the true reaſon why it did ſo was not <hi>Tradition,</hi> no, <hi>that</hi> was not ſo much as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at firſt for the doing of it, but onely ſome ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary dangers and inconveniencies, which brought in a new cuſtom contrary to ancient Tradition: Theſe were the onely things inſiſted on in its defence at firſt, <hi>the danger of ſpilling the Wine, and the difficulty of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in ſome places, and the undecency of Laymens dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Beards in it:</hi> Theſe were the mighty rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which <hi>Gerſon</hi> brought of old againſt the <hi>Hereſie,</hi> as he calls it, of <hi>Communicating in both Kinds</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Tractatus Magiſtri Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannis de Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon contra hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſin de com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munionae Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum ſub utra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſpecie.</note>; as if it were a new Hereſie to believe that Wine might be ſpilt, or that men wore Beards, or as if the Sacrament were appointed only for thoſe Countreys where there were Vines growing. <hi>De Meaux</hi> was very ſenſible of the weakneſs and folly of thoſe pretences, though they are the <hi>pericula</hi> and the <hi>ſcandala</hi> meant by the Council of
<hi>Conſtance,</hi> and therefore he takes very little notice of them, and indeed he has quite taken away all their arguments againſt the particular uſe of the Wine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="137" facs="tcp:36224:108"/>he all along pleades for
<hi>either</hi> of the Species, and owns it to be indifferent which of them ſo ever is uſed in the Sacrament: But I have ſhewn that both of them are neceſſary to make a true Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe both are commanded, and both inſtituted, and both of them equally belong to the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and ſo to the eſſence of it, and both are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily neceſſary to the receiving the inward Grace and Vertue of the Sacrament, becauſe that is annext to both by the Inſtitution, and cannot warrantably be expected without both.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore, <hi>Communion in One Kind</hi> is both contrary to the Inſtitution and to the Command of Chriſt, and to the Tradition and Practice of the Primitive Church grounded upon that Command, and is no leſs in it ſelf than a ſacrilegious dividing and mangling of the moſt ſacred Myſtery of Chriſtianity, a deſtroying the very Nature of the Sacrament, which is to repreſent the Death of Chriſt, and his Blood ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Body; a leſſening the ſignification and reception of our compleat and entire ſpiritual Nouriſhment, whereby we are Sacramentally to eat Chriſt's Body and drink his Bloud; an unjuſt depriving the People of that moſt pretious Legacy which Chriſt left to all of them, to wit, His Sacrificial Bloud which was ſhed for us, and which it is the peculiar privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtians thus myſtically to partake of; and laſtly, a robbing them of that Grace, and Vertue, and Benefit of the Sacrament which belongs not to any part, but to the whole of it, and cannot ordinarily be received without both kinds: O that God would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore put it into the hearts of thoſe who are moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, not to do ſo much injury to Chriſtians and to Chriſtianity; and not to ſuffer any longer
<hi>that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majeſty,</hi> which is the great Foundation of all Spiritual Grace and Life, to be tainted and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned <pb n="138" facs="tcp:36224:109"/>with ſo many corruptions as we find it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other parts of Chriſtianity! And O that that bleſſed Sacrament which was deſigned by Chriſt to be the very Bond of Peace, and the Cement of Unity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all Chriſtians, and to make them <hi>all one Bread and one Body,</hi> may not by the perverſneſs of men and the craft of the Devil, be made a means to divide and ſeparate them from each other, and to break that Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Charity which it ought to preſerve!</p>

                  <head>A DISCOURSE OF THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASS.</head>
                  <p>THE Sacrifice of the Maſs is the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable part of Worſhip in the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> It is their <hi>Juge ſacrificium,</hi> their dayly and continual Offering, and the principal Thing in which their Religion does conſiſt; It is, they tell us, of the greateſt profit and advantage to all perſons, and I am ſure their Prieſts make it ſo to themſelves, for by this alone a great number of them get their Livings, by making merchandiſe of the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by ſelling the Blood of Chriſt at a dearer rate then <hi>Judas</hi> once did; The ſaying of Maſſes keeps the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> more Prieſts in pay, then any Prince in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> can maintain Souldiers; and it has raiſed more Money by them, then the richeſt Bank or <pb n="2" facs="tcp:36224:113"/>Exchequer in the World was ever owner of; 'tis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the trueſt Patrimony of their Church, and has enricht it more then any thing elſe; it was that which founded their greateſt Monaſteries, and their Richeſt Abbies, and it had well nigh brought all the Eſtates of this Kingdom into the Church, had not the Statutes of <hi>Mortmain</hi> put a check to it; The Donation of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> were it never ſo true, and the Grants of
<hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Pepin,</hi> were they never ſo large, and the Gifts of all their Benefactors put together, are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly outdone by it; the Gain of it has been ſo manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly great that one cannot but upon that account a little ſuſpect its Godlineſs, but yet if it could fairly be made out to be a true part of Religion, it were by no means to be rejected for that accidental though ſhameful abuſe of it: It is accounted by them the greateſt, and the moſt uſeful and comfortable part of Chriſtian Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and if it be ſo, it is a great defect in us that want it; they charge us very high for being without it, without a Sacrifice, which no Religion (they tell us) in the World ever was before: and one amongſt them of great Learning, and ſome temper in other things, yet upon this occaſion askes, <hi>whether it can be doubted, where there is no Sacrifice, there can be any Religion</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">An dubitari poteſt ubi nullum peculiare Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitium, ibi ne Religionem qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem eſſe poſſe?

                     </note>? We on the other ſide account it a very great corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the Euchariſt, to turn that which is a Sacrament to be received by us into a Sacrifice to be offer'd to God, and there being no Foundation for any ſuch thing in Scripture, but the whole ground of it being an Error and miſtake, as we ſhall ſee anon, and it being a moſt bold and daring preſumption, to pretend proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Sacrifice Chriſts body again which implyes no leſs then to Murder and Crucifie him; we therefore call it a <hi>Blaſphemous Fable</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">See Article 31. of the 39 Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</note>, and as it is made uſe of to deceive people into the vain hopes of receiving benefit by the Communion without partaking of it, and a true <pb n="3" facs="tcp:36224:113"/>pardon of ſin by way of price, and recompence is attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it, and it is made as truly propitiatory as Chriſts ſacrifice upon the Croſs, both for the dead and living, and for that purpoſe is ſcandalouſly bought and ſold, ſo that many are hereby cheated not onely of their mony but of their ſouls too, it is to be feared, who truſt too much to this eaſie way of having a great many Maſſes ſaid for them, and becauſe when the prieſt pretends to do thoſe two great things in the Maſs, to turn the Bread and Wine into the very ſubſtance of Chriſts Body and Blood, and then to offer Chriſt up again to his Father as truly as he offered himſelf upon the croſs, which are as great as the greateſt works which ever God did at the very Creation and Redemption of the World) yet that he really does no ſuch thing as he then vaunts and boaſts of; for theſe Reaſons we deem it no leſs then a
<hi>dangerous deceit</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are high charges on both ſides, and it concerns thoſe who make them to be well aſſured of the grounds of them. And here I cannot but paſſionately reſent the ſad ſtate of Chriſtianity, which will certainly be very heavy upon thoſe who have been the cauſe of it, when the corruptions of it are ſo great, and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo wide about that which is one of the moſt ſacred and the moſt uſeful parts of it, the Bleſſed Euchariſt; which is above any other the moſt ſadly depraved and perverted, as if the Devil had hereby ſhown his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt malice and ſubtlety, to poyſon one of the greateſt Fountains of Chriſtianity, and to make that which ſhould yield the Waters of Life be the Cup of deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. That bleſſed Sacrament which was deſigned to unite Chriſtians, is made the very bone of Contention, and the greateſt inſtrument to divide them; and that bread of Life is turned into a ſtone, and become the great Rock of offence between them. Beſides the leſſer corruptions of the Euchariſt in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <pb n="4" facs="tcp:36224:114"/>ſuch as uſing thin Wafers inſtead of bread, and inject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them whole into the mouths of the Communicants, and Conſecrating without a Prayer, and ſpeaking the words of Conſecration ſecretly, and the like; there are four ſuch great ones as violate and deſtroy the very ſubſtance and Eſſence of the Sacrament, and make it to be a quite other thing then Chriſt ever intended it, and therefore ſuch as make Communion with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Altar</hi> utterly ſinful and unlawful: Theſe are the Adoration of the Hoſt, or making the Sacrament an object of Divine Worſhip; the Communion in one Kind, or taking away the Cup from the People; the turning the Sacrament into a true and proper Sacrifice propitiatory for the Quick and the Dead, and the uſing of private or ſolitary Maſſes, wherein the Prieſt who celebrates, Communicates alone. The two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe have been conſidered in ſome late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes upon thoſe ſubjects; the fourth is a reſult and conſequence of the third, for when the Sacrament was turned into a ſacrifice the people left off the frequent communicating, and expected to be benefitted by it another way; ſo that this will fall in as to the main Reaſons of it, with what I now deſign to conſider and Examine, The Sacrifice of the Maſs or Altar, wherein the Prieſt every time he celebrates the Communion is ſuppoſed to offer to God the Body and Blood of Chriſt under the forms of Bread and Wine, as truely as Chriſt once offered himſelf upon the croſs, and that this is as true a proper and propitiatory Sacrifice as the other, and that 'tis ſo not only for the Living but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the Dead. The Objections we make againſt it and the Arguments by which they defend it will fall in together at the ſame time, and I ſhall endeavour fairly and impartially to repreſent them in their utmoſt ſtrength, that ſo what we have to ſay againſt it, and what they have to ſay for it, may be offered to the <pb n="5" facs="tcp:36224:114"/>Reader at one view, that he may the better judg of thoſe high charges which are made, he ſees, on each ſide.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then we ſay, That the very foundation of this Sacrifice of the Maſs, is eſtabliſhed upon two very great Errors and Miſtakes: The one is the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation or Chriſts Corporal preſence in the Euchariſt; The other is the Opinion, That Chriſt did offer up his body and blood as a ſacrifice to God in his laſt Supper, before he offered up himſelf upon the Croſs: If either or both of theſe prove falſe, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs is ſo far from being true, that it muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground, according to their own principles and acknowledgments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no Scripture ground for any ſuch ſacrifice, but it is expreſly contrary to Scripture; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which head I ſhall examine all their Scriptural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences for it, and produce ſuch places as are directly contrary to it, and perfectly overthrow it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That it has no juſt claim to Antiquity, nor was there any ſuch Doctrine or practiſe in the Primitive Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, That it is in it ſelf unreaſonable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and has a great many groſs Errors involved in it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt we ſay, That the very Foundation of this ſacrifice is eſtabliſhed upon two very great Errors and Miſtakes, the firſt of which is the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, or which may be ſufficient for their purpoſe, the corporal preſence of Chriſts natural body and blood in the Euchariſt, though they diſclaim the belief of this without the other: but if Chriſts body and blood be not ſubſtantially preſent under the ſpecies of bread and Wine, they have no ſubject matter for a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, for 'tis not the bread and wine which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36224:115"/>to offer, nor the bare ſpecies and accidents of thoſe, nor can they call them a proper propitiatory ſacrifice, but 'tis the very natural body and blood of Chriſt, under the ſpecies of bread and wine, or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, for they with the ſpecies make one entire ſubject for ſacrifice, and one entire object for Adoration, as they are forced to confeſs<note n="†" place="margin">Panis &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Domini, Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num &amp; ſanguis Domini non ſunt duo ſacrificia ſed unum, —ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que enim offeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus corpus Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini abſolutè, ſed offerimus cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus Domini in ſpecie panis, <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm. de Miſſ. l. 1. c. 37.</hi>
                     </note>; So that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their own principles, they muſt both ſacrifice and adore ſomething in the Euchariſt beſides the very body and blood of Chriſt, which is a difficulty they will never get off, but I deſign not to preſs them with that now, but Tranſubſtantiation upon which their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs is founded, is ſo great a difficulty that it bears down before it all ſenſe and reaſon, and only makes way for Church Authority to tryumph over both; Their wiſeſt men have given up Scripture for it, and frankly confeſt, it were not neceſſary to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it without the determination of the Church, and if ſo then without the Churches determination, there had been no foundation it ſeems for the ſacrifice of the Maſs. for there can be none for that without Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and
'tis very ſtrange that a ſacrifice ſhould be thus founded, not upon Scripture or a Divine inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but only in effect upon the Churches declaration, and ſhould have no true bottom without that, as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thoſe men it really has not. But Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation is a Monſter that ſtartles and affrights the boldeſt Faith, if the Church be not by to encourage and ſupport it; 'tis too terrible to be looked upon in its ſelf without having a thick miſt of Church Authority and Infallibility firſt caſt before a mans eyes, and then if there were not a ſtrange and almoſt faſcinating pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in ſuch principles, one would think it impoſſible that any man who has both eyes and brains in his head ſhould believe a Wafer were the body of a man, or that a crum of bread were a fleſhly ſubſtance, they do <pb n="7" facs="tcp:36224:115"/>not indeed believe them to be both, but they believe one to be the other which is the ſame thing; there is nothing can expoſe ſuch a doctrine, for nothing can be more uncouth and extravagant then itsſelf, it not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes away all evidence of ſenſe upon which all truth of miracles, and ſo of all Revelation does depend, but it deſtroys all manner of certainty, and all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of truth and knowledge, it makes one body be a thouſand, or at leaſt be at the ſame time in a thouſand places, by which means the leaſt atome may fill the whole World; Again it makes the parts of a body to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate one another, by which means all the matter of the whole World may be brought to a ſingle point, it makes the whole to be no greater then a part, and one part to be as great as the whole; thus it deſtroys the nature of things, and makes a body to be a ſpirit, and an accident to be a ſubſtance, and renders every thing we ſee or taſte to be only phantaſm and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and though the World ſeems crouded with ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, yet according to <hi>that</hi> it may be all but ſpecies and ſhadow, and ſuperficies. So big is this opinion with abſurdities and inconſiſtencies and contradictions, and yet theſe muſt all go down and paſs into an Article of Faith before there can be any foundation for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, and let any one judge that has not loſt his judgment by believing Tranſubſtantiation, what a ſtrange production that muſt be which is to be the genuine of-ſpring of ſuch a doctrine. It is not my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, nor muſt it be my preſent task to diſcourſe at large of that, or to confute the little ſophiſtries with which it is thought neceſſary to make it outface the common reaſon of mankind. There never was any pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox needed more ſtraining to defend it, nor any Sceptical principle but would bear as fair a wrangle on its behalf, there is a known Treatiſe has ſo laid this cauſe on its back, that it can never be able to riſe again, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36224:116"/>and though after a long time it endeavours a little to ſtir, and heave, and ſruggle, yet if it thereby provokes another blow from the ſame hand, it muſt expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs then its mortal wound.</p>
                  <p>I paſs to the next Error and Miſtake upon which the ſacrifice of the Maſs is founded, and that is this, that our bleſſed Saviour did at his laſt Supper when he celebrated the Communion with his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples offer up his body and blood to his Father as a true propitiatory ſacrifice, before he offered it as ſuch upon the Croſs. This they pretend, and are forced to do ſo to eſtabliſh their ſacrificing in the Maſs, for they are only to do that in the Sacrament, they own, which Chriſt himſelf did, and which he commanded his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles to doe, and if this ſacrifice had not its inſtitution and appointment at that time, it never had any at all, as they cannot but grant. Let us then enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt did thus ſacrifice himſelf and offer up his body and blood to God at his laſt Supper: Is there any the leaſt colour or ſhadow of any ſuch thing in any of the accounts that is given of this in the three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts or in St. <hi>Paul? The Lord Jeſus the ſame night in which he was betrayed took bread and gave thanks, or bleſſed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Diſciples, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, take eat this is my Body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of me, after the ſame manner alſo he took the Cup and gave thanks, and gave it to them, ſaying, drink ye all of this, for this is my blood of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is ſhed for you, and for many for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Is here any mention or any intimation of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering up any thing to God? Was not the bread and the cup, and what he called his body and his blood gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his Diſciples to be eaten and drank by them? and was any thing elſe done with them? is there any thing like an offering or a ſacrificing of them? yes ſay they, Chriſt there calls it his <hi>body which is broken and his <pb n="9" facs="tcp:36224:116"/>blood which is ſhed,</hi> in the preſent tenſe; therefore the one muſt be then broken and the other ſhed; So indeed it is in the Original <hi>Greek,</hi> though in the Vulgar Latin it is in the future tenſe, and ſo it is alſo put in their Miſſal, <hi>ſanguis qui effundetur, this is my Blood which ſhall be ſhed,</hi> and is it not uſual to put the preſent tenſe inſtead of the future, when that is ſo near and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? Does not our Saviour do it more than once at other times? <hi>The Son of man is betrayed into the hands of ſinners,</hi>

That the Apoſtles were made Prieſts by Chriſt at his laſt Supper, by thoſe words, <hi>hoc facite, do this,</hi> is ſo precarious and ſenſeleſs an opinion, that it only ſhows what wonderful ſtreights and extremities our adverſaries are driven to, who are forced to eſpouſe this to ſupport their ill-framed Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis about the Holy Euchariſt, in thoſe two do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the <hi>Communion in One Kind, and the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs.</hi> There is not one Father or Antient Interpreter, that gives any the leaſt countenance to it, and many of their own Authors are aſhamed of it, as may be ſeen in a late Diſcourſe of the <hi>Communion in One Kind</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">pag.
15.</note>, where this is ſo fully expoſed that I ſhall here ſay no more of it, but that if thoſe words make the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Prieſts, it makes them ſo twice, for they are twice repeated by our Saviour after giving the Cup, as well as after giving the bread, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſes, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 11.25. and ſo the character of Prieſthood muſt be dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they muſt be twice ordained at the ſame time, when there is nothing appears like any Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all; but if they were then made Prieſts they were not made ſo to ſacrifice Chriſts Body and Blood, or to do more then he did at that time: and ſo this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe if he himſelf did not then truly offer and ſacrifice himſelf, which is the plaineſt thing in the World he did not. And what ſhould make any man imagine that Chriſts body was broke, and his blood ſhed at his laſt Supper; or that he then ſacrificed and offered up himſelf I cannot conceive. Had he been no otherwiſe ſacrificed, nor his body any otherwiſe bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, nor his blood in any otherway ſhed beſides this the Jews had been liable to much leſs guilt, but mankind had bin a more wretched condition, for Chriſt had not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36224:117"/>Redeemed them had he not dyed for them upon the Croſs. If the ſacrifice of Chriſt at his laſt Supper, the night before his crucifixion, was a true proper and propitiatory ſacrifice, what needed he have ſuffered the next day, if that was of the ſame nature and value with the other, as they ſay, and did truly propitiate God, and procure pardon and remiſſion of ſins for mankind, what need was there of the Croſs of Chriſt? it was hereby made void and of none Effect, or at leaſt of no neceſſity. If Chriſt had done the work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, his ſacrifice upon the Altar or the Table might have excuſed his ſacrifice upon the Croſs, and thus the bitter Cup might have paſt from him, and he might have been Crucifyed only in Effigie, and ſlain myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and ſacramentally; and his body might have been thus broken and his blood ſhed, and yet the one have been ſtill whole, and the other in his veins.</p>
                  <p>For theſe Reaſons one of their own Biſhops in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> denyed openly, <hi>That Chriſt offered up any proper ſacrifice at his laſt Supper</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Cornelius E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopas Biton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus, in concilio apud Tridentum, —qui dixerit Chriſtum in cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ non ſuum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus &amp; ſanguinem obtuliſſe,
<hi>Canus in loc. Theol. l. 12.</hi>
                     </note>. But if he did not then there was no ground for them ever to offer any in the Euchariſt, and therefore the Council was forced to declare he did, though no ſuch thing appears in the Evangelical Hiſtory, nor could any collect it from thence, but it was a neceſſary after-thought, and a groundleſs ſuppoſal, to help out and eſtabliſh the ſacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is no Scripture ground for any ſuch ſacrifice, but 'tis expreſly contrary to Scripture, to ſacrifice Chriſt over again, and to have any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory ſacrifice beſides that of the Croſs, and to offer up Chriſts body and blood every day which was to be but once offered and that by himſelf. I have already ſhown that the greateſt foundation of this their ſacrifice out of Scripture, which is Chriſt offering up himſelf at his laſt Supper and commanding others to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36224:118"/>offer him there is a miſtake, and if it be ſo, all their other Scriptural pretences are vain and to no purpoſe; and muſt be ſo acknowledged by themſelves, for there is none other that does inſtitute and appoint any ſuch ſacrifice, or can with any colour or ſhadow be pretended to do ſo, and I hope they will own that without a divine inſtitution, there cannot be a proper and much leſs a propitiatory ſacrifice, and this indeed they do, they confeſs that <hi>it is not in the power of the Church to inſtitute a ſacrifice</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="margin">Non eſt in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtate Eccleſiae. inſtituere Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,

                     </note>. <hi>And that the very being and Eſſence of this ſacrifice depends upon the Inſtitution of Chriſt</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Tota Eſſentia Sacrificii pendet ex inſtitutione Chriſti, <hi>Salme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> ib. <hi>Suarez. Tom. 3. Diſp.

                     </note>. If that be then taken away, and there be no ſuch thing in Scripture as I have ſhown there is not, then whatever other places they can produce to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh this are all inſignificant and to no purpoſe; for if they did mention this either by way of Prophecy or of Hiſtory, yet if it be no where inſtituted, this will not do the buſineſs, for the Inſtitution ought not to be ſuppoſed but clearly proved and made out, and if that cannot be, every thing elſe that is to ſupport it as a collateral evidence falls to the ground. What will it ſignifie if <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did offer Bread and Wine not to <hi>Abraham</hi> only but to God, and as a Prieſt did ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice them, rather then make an hoſpitable entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, is this any foundation for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs? If Chriſt did not inſtitute that at his laſt Supper with his Diſciples,
<hi>Melchiſedec</hi> I hope did not inſtitute it with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Souldiers. If the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> ſpeaks never ſo much of a pure offering, yet if Chriſt did not offer up himſelf in the Sacrament, nor command the Apoſtles to offer him up there, <hi>Malachi</hi>'s Propheſie will not make the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt to be a ſacrifice or a pure offering, if Chriſt did not make it ſo: nor will the Prieſts I ſuppoſ deſire their power of ſacrificing either from <hi>Melchiſedecs</hi> act or
<hi>Malachi</hi>'s prediction without Chriſts Inſtitution; it is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:36224:118"/>not only a preſumption but a demonſtration that thoſe Scriptures which they bring, do not really mean or truly ſpeak of any ſuch thing, as <hi>The ſacrifice of the Maſs,</hi> when there is no ſuch thing any where inſtituted or appointed by Chriſt, and without ſuch an inſtitution there cannot (as they confeſs) be any ground for it. All their little ſcattered forces therefore which they rally and pick up here and there out of Scripture, and which againſt their will they preſs into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Maſs-ſacrifice are hereby wholly cut off and utterly defeated, by having their main ſtrength without which they can do nothing of themſelves, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from them, and I ſhall examine them only to ſhow the weakneſs of them, which they being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible of themſelves endeavour to make up their want of ſtrength by the greatneſs of their number; and ſurely never were ſo many places brought out of Scripture to ſo little purpoſe, as what they produce for the ſacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then they go back as far as <hi>Geneſis</hi> for it, and it is very ſtrange they ſhould find it there; this will make it very primitive and ancient indeed, but where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they meet with bread and Wine, which are things of very great Antiquity, they reſolve to make a ſacrifice of them; eſpecially if there be but a Prieſt by who has the power of Conſecrating, for they ſuppoſe he muſt preſently fall to his office and put on his habit if bread and wine be before him, and that he cannot like other men eat and drink them as his ordinary food or entertain his friends and others with them, except he not only Religiouſly bleſs them by Prayer and Thanksgiving which every good man ought to do, and it was the cuſtom even of the Heathens to do this before they ate, but he muſt ſacrifice and offer them up to God. This they will needs have <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> do in the 14. of <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. <hi>verſe. Melchiſedec King of <pb n="14" facs="tcp:36224:119"/>Salem brought forth bread and wine, and he was the Prieſt of the moſt High God.</hi> What is there here to ſhow that <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> offered bread and wine as a ſacrifice to God, the very word in their own vulgar Latin anſwering to the Hebrew is <hi>protulit, he brought forth,</hi> not <hi>obtulit, he offered;</hi> and if it were the latter, could not he offer bread and wine to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany upon a Table, but muſt it neceſſarily be to God upon an Altar? <hi>Abraham</hi> with his Three Hundred and Eighteen Trained Servants,<note place="margin">Ver. 14, 15.</note> had been by night pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing thoſe who had taken away his brother

Did <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> know they had eaten? Or does the Scripture ſay ſo? Or might not he treat them as a King though they had victuals of their own? How does <hi>Bellarmine</hi> know they were firſt ſacrificed when there is not the leaſt word of that? Ay, but it is ſaid that he was the Prieſt of the moſt high God, therefore it is likely he ſacrificed, why elſe ſhould that be added? It was added becauſe he was ſo, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as it immediately follows, <hi>he bleſſed</hi> Abraham,<note place="margin">Ver. 19.20.</note> 
                     <hi>and</hi> Abraham <hi>gave him Tithes of all his ſpoils,</hi> this is more likely than becauſe he ſacrificed, for there is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that as of the other, and 'tis not ſaid he brought forth bread and wine becauſe he was the Prieſt of the high God, 'tis only a conjunctive particle, <hi>and, he was,</hi> not a cauſal <hi>for.</hi> It is ſaid alſo in the ſame place, <hi>that he was King of Salem,</hi> and why might not his entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Abraham</hi> be as he was a King, becauſe he is ſaid there to be a King, as well as a Prieſt, and yet I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Prieſt may be ſaid to treat his Friends, as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man without officiating then as a Prieſt, though he be called a Prieſt. Why
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſhould cite any Fathers for his Opinion I cannot imagine, ſince the oldeſt of them are I ſuppoſe ſo much latter, and at ſo great a diſtance from the times of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> that they could no more know what <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did at that time then we can now, and they are very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per witneſſes of a matter of fact that was ſo long ago, which nothing but the Scripture hiſtory can give us any account of, to which itis not only precarious but raſh to add any of our own gueſſes and conjectures; however tho ſome of the Fathers do by way of figure and alluſion, make this bread and wine of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dec,</hi> to relate to the Sacramental bread and wine, as they make Manna, and ſeveral other things which were not ſacrifices, yet none apply it to the ſacrifice of the Maſs, nor could they well do it ſince they believed <pb n="16" facs="tcp:36224:120"/>no ſuch thing in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> ſenſe, as I ſhall ſhow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards. But after all, what if <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> did ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice bread and wine? What ſervice will this do to the ſacrifice of the Maſs? The Prieſts do not there ſacrifice bread and wine according to this Myſtical Type, nor did <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> ſure offer up Chriſts body and bloud under the ſpecies of his bread &amp; wine; if we allow all that can be begged and deſired that <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedec</hi> did ſacrifice, and that this his ſacrifice was a Type and figure of another ſacrifice, why may not that be of the ſacrifice of the Croſs, which is the true and only proper Chriſtian ſacrifice, when Chriſt the Bread of Life was offered up unto God for us? So that there is no neceſſity to bring in the ſacrifice of the Maſs to complete and anſwer this figure, were there any thing in it beſides gueſſe and fancy which I ſee no manner of reaſon to believe there is, ſince there is nothing to countenance it in the New Teſtament, and 'tis very preſumptuous and ungrounded to make any thing a true Type, or to have a Typical meaning farther then Gods Spirit, which alone could know this, has given us warrant to do it by Revelation. Yet without any ſuch ground both <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">de
<hi>Miſſâ</hi> l. 1. c. 6.</note>, and the Council of
<hi>Trent</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. 6. c. 1.</note>, make this to be the notion of Chriſt being a Prieſt after the order of
<hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> that he was to offer up a viſible and unbloody ſacrifice of bread and wine, and to appoint others to do this for ever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as as the Scripture makes Chriſt to be a Prieſt after the Order of
<hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> not upon any ſuch account: for the Author to the Hebrews makes not the leaſt menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this in his large diſcourſe of this matter<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 5.7.</note>, but in his having no Predeceſſor nor no Succeſſor in his Prieſthood, as
<hi>Melchiſedec</hi> is repreſented in Scripture without any account of his Family or Genealogy, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Father, without Mother, without Deſcent, Heb.</hi> 7. <hi>v.</hi> 3. and in the excellency of that in general above the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect <pb n="17" facs="tcp:36224:120"/>
                     <hi>Aaronic</hi> Prieſthood, and in the Eternity and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutability of it, <hi>becauſe he continueth ever, and hath an unchangeable Prieſthood, verſe</hi> 24. How little the
<hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedecian</hi> Prieſthood of Chriſt, upon which they lay ſo much ſtreſs, will ſerve the purpoſe of the Maſs-ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, nay how contrary 'tis to it, I ſhall endeavour to manifeſt in a few particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, Chriſt it is plain did offer up to God not an unbloody, but a bloody ſacrifice upon the Croſs; I ask whether he did this according to his <hi>Melchiſede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Prieſthood? If he did, then
<hi>Melchiſedec</hi> probably as Prieſt of the High God might offer the bloody ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of living creatures, and if he were <hi>Shem</hi> the Eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> as is fairly conjectured by Learned men, he might learn this of his Father, who after the Flood <hi>built an Altar unto the Lord, and took of every clean beaſt, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt-offerings on the Altar, Gen.</hi> 8.20. but then how will this be reconciled with what our adverſaries pretend, that it was the proper and peculiar office of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> to offer the pure and unbloody ſacrifice of bread and wine? And that according to that the Roman Prieſts are to do that, and that Chriſt did that at his laſt Supper. Chriſts Prieſthood was the ſame at his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and upon the Croſs, if he acted therefore as a Prieſt of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> in one, he did ſo in both.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Scripture mentions no Act or Office of
<hi>Melchiſedec</hi>'s Prieſthood but in bleſſing <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 14.18, 19. <hi>Melchiſedec King of Salem brought forth bread and Wine, and he was the Prieſt of the moſt high God, and he bleſſed him, and ſaid, bleſſed be</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>of the moſt high God which hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.</hi> And this the Authour to the
<hi>Hebrews</hi> takes particular notice of<note n="†" place="margin">ch.
7. v. 1.</note>, and this anſwers to what St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays of Chriſt after his Reſurrection, <pb n="18" facs="tcp:36224:121"/>
                     <hi>God having raiſed up his ſon Jeſus ſent him to bleſs you</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Acts 3.26.</note>, which general word of bleſſing may include in it, whatever is done for us by Chriſts Prieſthood after his Reſurrection, particularly his praying and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding to God for us. Had it been any part of Chriſts <hi>Melchiſedecian</hi> Prieſthood to offer up bread and wine, much more had it wholly conſiſted in this, 'tis ſtrange the Apoſtle in a ſet and large diſcourſe of this, ſhould not ſpeak one word, nor take the leaſt notice of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Chriſt is to have none to ſucceed him in his
<hi>Melchiſedecian</hi> Prieſthood, but he was himſelf to remain a Prieſt for ever; the Author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> makes this difference between the <hi>Aaronical</hi> Prieſts and Chriſt, that they were to ſucceed one another, <hi>and they truly were many Priests, becauſe they were not ſuffered to continue by reaſon of death</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Heb. 7.23.</note>, but Chriſt was an immortal and ſo a perpetual Prieſt, <hi>but this man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable prieſthood</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Verſe
24.</note>, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a Prieſthood that paſſes not to others but is ever fixt and appropriate to his own perſon, <hi>and he is made a Prieſt, after the power of an endleſs Life</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Verſe 16.</note>. That which belongs then to Chriſt as he is an immortal Prieſt, and continueth ever, and hath none to ſucceed him, that it is which conſtitutes his Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decian Prieſthood, and what that is the Apoſtle plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly informs us in the very next verſe to thoſe I have quoted, <hi>ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for us</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Verſe 24.</note>. Chriſts interceding with God by vertue of his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the croſs, and appearing in heaven in the preſence of God for us, and there preſenting his ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to his Father, and powerfully mediating on our behalf, this is his proper unchangeable, eternal, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſitive <hi>Melchiſedecian</hi> Prieſthood, and 'tis great ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance for any to pretend to ſhare with him or to ſucceed him therefore in his proper Prieſthood, and to <pb n="19" facs="tcp:36224:121"/>call themſelves as the Romaniſts do, Prieſts after the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> when none but Chriſt is ſo; This his prieſthood is not committed to any upon Earth, but is to be for ever executed and diſcharged by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in heaven, and he has left none to be proper prieſts in this ſenſe, but only to be Miniſters to this great High prieſt, in performing ſome leſſer though peculiar Offices proper to them, as the Levites under the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpenſation had their proper work though they were not proper prieſts.</p>
                  <p>The next thing they produce out of Scripture for the Sacrifice of the Maſs, is the Paſchal Lamb, which they will needs have to be a figure of the Euchariſt; and ſince that was a ſacrifice, therefore the Euchariſt which was figured by it ought to be ſo too; Now theſe figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Arguments though they help to make ſome ſhow as they are dreſt out by fancy, yet they have generally this fault that they prove either too much or too little, and ſo either ſhoot over the mark, or fall a great deal ſhort of it, but ſeldom hit it. The Paſchal Lamb, and the Euchariſt, the Chriſtian Paſſeover, do agree in this that they are both ſolemn and religious Rites, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative of a great deliverance, and that they are both Sacred and Myſtical Feaſts wherein ſomething is to be eaten with joy and thankfulneſs, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our inſtituted one to ſucceed and take place of the other, in theſe particulars they ſuit and have an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Analogy with one another; but figures are like Circles, which may touch one another in ſome points but not in all, for if we go any farther they will nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſarily divide and differ. The paſchal Lamb was to be eaten but once a year, the Euchariſt much oftner, that was a feaſt of viſible and ſolid fleſh, the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt only of bread and wine; or if there be any fleſh, 'tis inviſible and as like bread and wine as can be, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <pb n="20" facs="tcp:36224:122"/>ever this is the fleſh, according to our adverſaries, of a living man, that of a dead and roaſted Lamb, this is not to be ſlain but eaten whole and alive, the other was, and therefore why may we not adde, to go no further, this is no proper ſacrifice, that probably was, for it is not paſt queſtion whether it was or no, but yet ſuch a ſacrifice as was offered without a prieſt by every Maſter of a Family: and if the Euchariſt were to agree with it in this, the prieſts would looſe a great deal of their deſign in making it a ſacrifice, for then without hiring them every houſe-keeper would offer it himſelf; beſides the paſchal Lamb was not a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſacrifice, I preſume, for the quick and dead, ſo then in correſpondence to that neither is the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, but only an Euchariſtic one: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the paſchal Lamb was not truly a Type and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Euchariſt but of Chriſt crucified, ſo ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly, <hi>Christ our Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us</hi>

'Tis a ſort of Judaiſm then and a returning back to that leſs perfect and leſs ſpiritual ſtate to make the Religion of the Goſpel conſiſt in any viſible and external ſacrifice which our Adverſaries ſo earneſtly contend for, rather in thoſe ſacrifices which are more ſpiritual, and therefore more truly Chriſtian, and more agreeable to the ſpiritual Worſhip, and the ſpiritual Oeconomy of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome other places of the old Teſtament brought by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and other defenders of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Maſs, which are ſo weak and impertinent that they only ſerve to expoſe it, and therefore they are not at all mentioned in the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> or in the Roman Catechiſm, ſuch is that ſaying of the prophet to <hi>Eli,</hi>
2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.35. <hi>That God would raiſe up a faithful prieſt, that ſhall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind, and I will build him a ſure houſe, and he ſhall walk before mine anointed for ever.</hi> This new prieſt that was to ſucceed <hi>Eli</hi> was very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably to be a ſacrificing prieſt, but that he was to offer the ſacrifice of the Maſs, I leave thoſe who bring this place for it, to prove; for without doubt this was fulfilled long before Chriſt, in
<hi>Samuel</hi> who ſucceeded <hi>Eli,</hi> and in <hi>Zadoc</hi> who came in the room of <hi>Abiathar</hi> who was of the Family of <hi>Eli,</hi> and who
<hi>was thruſt out by Solomon from being prieſt unto the Lord, that he might <pb n="26" facs="tcp:36224:125"/>fulfil the word of the Lord, which he ſpake concerning the houſe of Eli in Shilo,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.27. as the Scripture obſerves, and to make this figurative or prophetical of the Chriſtian prieſthoods ſucceeding the <hi>Aaronical</hi> is great ſtrength of fancy, but a very weak argument however for the ſacrifice of the Maſs, unleſs that were the work of the Chriſtian prieſthood which is hard to be made out.</p>
                  <p>The Second is that out of the 72, <hi>Pſalm</hi> at the 16.

<hi>Galatinus</hi> made into a cake or <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centa,</hi> and that muſt needs be the wafer cake, which being upon the top of the Mountains, muſt be heaved and elevated over the head of the prieſts.

                  <p>I ſhall mention but one more which if it be not as ridiculous, yet is as impertinent as the other, and that is out of <hi>Daniel, chapter</hi> 8. <hi>verſe</hi> 11. where it is ſaid <hi>the dayly ſacrifice was taken away,</hi> by a great prince, that is there prophetically deſcribed.

                     <hi>verſe</hi> 24. is not to Worſhip him by an external, viſible, Typical ſacrifice as the Maſs is, and as thoſe of the Jews were, but by a more pure and ſpiritual Worſhip of praiſe and thankſgiving, and prayer, ſuch as that of Chriſtians is to be, as more ſuitable to the ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God; and theſe ſpiritual ſacrifices of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not to be tyed to one place, as thoſe more groſs and carnal ones of the Jews were, which was the thing our Saviour here deſigned. The greateſt part of the publick Jewiſh Worſhip was fixt to the Temple and to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> their Tithes, and Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits, and Firſtlings, and Feſtivals as well as their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and there may be divine Worſhip without ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice as well as with it, and whatever the Worſhip be, which our Saviour here ſays was to be ſpiritual it was not like the Jewiſh, to be fixt to one place, which is the true ſcope of thoſe words to the <hi>Samaritan</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in anſwer to her queſtion,

<hi>Samaritans;</hi> our Saviour determines for neither, but puts an end to the queſtion, and ſays, that now under the Goſpel, the Worſhip of God was not local, and as to the manner of it, that it was ſpiritual.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond and principal Argument for the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Maſs, is from Chriſts inſtitution and firſt ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Euchariſt with his Diſciples, and here indeed is the true place to find it if there be any ſuch thing, but I have already ſhown<note n="‖" place="margin">pag. 8, 9, 10.</note> that Chriſt did nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then ſacrifice himſelf nor command his Diſciples to do ſo, and have taken away that which is the very Foundation of the Maſs-ſacrifice, and without which every thing elſe that can be ſaid for it falls to the ground.</p>

                     </note>; but if it were meant of the Euchariſt, that is but an Altar in an improper ſenſe, as the ſacrifice offered on it is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper and metaphorical as we ſhall prove, but in the place to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the Apoſtle Commands them not to eat of <hi>things offered to Idols,</hi> for to eat of them was to partake of things ſacrificed to Devils, and ſo to have communion with Devils, which was very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for thoſe who were partakers of the Lords Table, and therein truly communicated of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, as thoſe who are of the Jewiſh ſacrifices were partakers of the Jewiſh Altar. Now what is here of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, or any way ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to it? Why, yes, the Apoſtle compares the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36224:127"/>of the Lord with the Table of Devils, and eating of the Lords ſupper with eating the Jewiſh and the Heathen ſacrifices, therefore the Chriſtians ought to have an Altar as well as the Jews, and what they fed on, ought to be ſacrificed as well as the Heathen <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, but the Apoſtle ſays nothing of this, nor makes any ſuch compariſon between them, but only ſhows the unfitneſs of Chriſtians eating of the Heathen ſacrifices who partook of the Lords Table; he does not call the Lords Table an Altar, nor the Euchariſt a ſacrifice, nor was there any danger that the Chriſtians ſhould go to eat in the Idol Temples, but he would not have them eat of their ſacrifices brought home, and the whole compariſon lyes here, the eating the Lords Supper did make them true partakers of the Lords body and blood ſacrificed upon the Croſs, as eating of the Jewiſh ſacrifices did make the Jews partakers of the Jewiſh Altar, and as eating of things offered to Idols was having fellowſhip with Devils, ſo that they who partook of ſuch holy food as Chriſtians did, ſhould not communicate of ſuch execrable and diabolical food as the Heathen <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. If indeed Chriſtians could not partake of Chriſts body and blood in the Euchariſt unleſs they firſt made a proper ſacrifice and oblation of them, then the Apoſtles diſcourſe would neceſſarily ſuppoſe and imply them to be thus offered, as the Jewiſh and Heathen ſacrifices were before they were eaten, but ſince Chriſts body and blood being once offered upon the Croſs is a ſufficient ſacrifice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of them, and the Euchariſt is a religious and Sacramental Feaſt upon the ſacrifice of Chriſt once offered, this is ſufficient for the Apoſtles ſcope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in that place, where there is no other compariſon made between the Table of the Lord, and the Table of Devils, but that one makes us to be partakers of the body and blood of Chriſt, and the other to have <pb n="32" facs="tcp:36224:128"/>Fellowſhip with Devils, and as to the Jewiſh Altar the Antitheſis does not lye here as
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> would have it, between that and the Table of the Lord, that both have proper ſacrifices offered upon them, which are eaten after they are ſacrificed; but the Croſs of Chriſt rather is the Antitheſis to the Jewiſh Altar, on which ſacrifices were really and properly ſlain, which are not on the Chriſtian Altar, and the feeding and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of thoſe ſacrifices ſo offered, whereby they were made partakers of the Altar, this anſwers to the ſacramental feeding upon Chriſts body and blood in the Chriſtian Altar whereby we are made partakers of the Croſs of Chriſt, and have the vertue and merit of his ſacrifice communicated to us.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have conſidered and fully anſwered what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever our Adverſaries can bring out of Scripture for their ſacrifice of the Maſs, I ſhall now offer ſome places of Scripture that are directly contrary to it, and do perfectly overthrow it: and though their cauſe muſt neceſſarily ſink if the Scripture be not for it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without a Scriptural Foundation there can be no divine inſtitution of a ſacrifice which is neceſſary by their own confeſſion, and ſo eſſential a part of worſhip ought ſurely to be appointed by no leſs an Authority then of God himſelf, ſo that if it be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Scripture-grounds it muſt like a Caſtle in the Air fall of it ſelf, and can have nothing elſe to ſupport it. Yet I ſhall ſhow that Scripture is plainly againſt it and that ſo ſtrong a battery may be raiſed and levelled at it from thence, that none of their Arts or devices can be able to withſtand it; it is from thoſe known places of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> from whence I have already ſhown how contrary their Doctrine is to our Saviours Melchiſedecian prieſthood, I ſhall now urge thoſe places out of that Epiſtle wherein the Divine <pb n="33" facs="tcp:36224:128"/>Authour of it, who was probably St. <hi>Paul,</hi> largely and deſignedly ſhoweth the excellency of Chriſts ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice above thoſe under the Law upon this account, that it had ſo much vertue and efficacy in it, that by <hi>one offering</hi> it obtained full and perfect Remiſſion of ſin, whereas this was the great imperfection of the others, and ſhowed their great weakneſs and inſufficiency that they were ſo often offered, and ſo frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, <hi>every prieſt</hi> of the Jews <hi>ſtandeth dayly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſin, chap.</hi> 10.11. And it was plain they could not take away ſin becauſe they were ſo often offered over again, either every day or every year, <hi>For the Law can never with thoſe ſacrifices which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect, chap.</hi>
10. <hi>verſe</hi> 1. <hi>For then would they not have ceaſed to be offered? becauſe that the worſhippers once purged, ſhould have had no more conſcience of ſins. But in thoſe ſacrifices there is a remembrance again made of ſins every year, verſe</hi> 2, 3. Thoſe ſacrifices being but like the acknowledgments of a Debtor, that he owed a great ſumm which he had no way fully to pay off and diſcharge, but he raiſed and brought what he could, and ſo owned the Debt, and that he had not where withal to take it quite off, nor to make that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and ſatisfaction which was neceſſary. But ſuch was the value of the ſacrifice of Chriſt, that it was a perfect price and payment, and made full ſatisfaction at once; ſo that <hi>By one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi> 14. and made ſuch full atonement and expiation by that, that there is no more need, nor <hi>remains no more ſacrifice for ſins, but this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God, verſe</hi> 12. as having fully done the work of a prieſt upon Earth, and having no need to offer any further ſacrifice, <hi>nor <pb n="34" facs="tcp:36224:129"/>yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth into the holy place, every year with blood of others: chap.</hi> 9.25. <hi>(For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world) but now once in the end of the world, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf, verſe</hi> 26. <hi>and Christ was once offered to bear the ſins of many, verſe</hi> 28. <hi>And we are ſanctified through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt once for all, chap.</hi> 10. verſe 10. <hi>So that Christ our high prieſt needeth not dayly, as thoſe high prieſts, to offer up ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, firſt for himſelf, and then for the people: For this he did once when he offered up himſelf,</hi> chap. 7. ver. 27. Nothing can be ſaid plainer againſt the ſacrifice of the Maſs, wherein Chriſt is often offered and that as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and truly, they pretend, as the Jewiſh ſacrifices were, or as he was upon the Croſs, when it is here ſo much inſiſted upon that Chriſts ſacrifice was but once offered, whereas thoſe under the Law were often; and this made an argument of their weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and of the full vertue and value of the other: Muſt it not appear very ſtrange after this that it ſhould be made the great part of ſome mens Religion, to repeat the ſame ſacrifice of Chriſt every day, and to offer him up again every day upon the Altar, as truly as the Jews offered their ſacrifices day by day continually, and as he once offered up himſelf upon the Croſs, and to make this dayly ſacrifice of him in the Maſs have as true a vertue to propitiate God and expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſins as the other had, and to be every way as true &amp; proper a ſacrifice as the other. I need not labour much to ſhow how contrary this is to this diſcourſe of the Authour to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> and to the true ſcope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of it, it appears ſo evidently to be ſo, that our Adverſaries are put to the greateſt ſtreights and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties imaginable to make themſelves think otherwiſe, and to reconcile what the Apoſtle here ſays of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice <pb n="35" facs="tcp:36224:129"/>of Chriſt, with what their Church ſays of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and that they are perfectly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent, notwithſtanding all their pretences and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, I ſhall make appear by what follows.</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, They tell us that their ſacrifice of the Maſs, is but the very ſame with the ſacrifice of Chriſt upon the Croſs, and ſo it does not at all take off from the vertue of that, or ſuppoſe that to be imperfect, ſince this is no other, nor no new ſacrifice, but only the ſame both in nature and vertue with <hi>that;</hi> if it were another ſacrifice indeed, or were ſuppoſed to have a diſtinct vertue and efficacy from that of the Croſs, it might reflect upon that, and be injurious to it, but ſince they declare it to be the ſame, they do not conceive how it is any way ſo. But the Apoſtles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe (for it is probable an Apoſtle was Authour of this Epiſtle) in the forementioned places, is about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſame ſacrifices, and offering them up year by year continually, and from hence he grounds the imperfection of them, and that they could not make the comers thereunto perfect, <hi>chap.</hi>
10. <hi>v.</hi> 1. Theſe ſacrifices indeed were many and of ſeveral ſorts which they offered, but they ſtill offered them up again and again, both dayly and yearly, and it was their often offering of them as well as their multitude which the Apoſtle reflects upon, <hi>their dayly miniſtring and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>verſe</hi>
11. whereas Chriſt by <hi>one</hi> ſacrifice and that <hi>once</hi> offered, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>verſe</hi> 28. did fully put away ſin, ſo that had the ſame ſacrifice of Chriſt been often offered, as the ſame ſacrifices of the Jews were, it had upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count been liable to the ſame charge of imperfection; for if <hi>by one offering it had for ever perfected them that are ſanctified,</hi> and had obtained perfect and plenary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and had done the whole work, and <pb n="36" facs="tcp:36224:130"/>had the whole effect of all that ſacrifices were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, then what need it be any further offered? the offering up the ſame ſacrifice, and continuing dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to offer it, ſhows that it was not ſufficient, nor did do the buſineſs at once offering, as the frequent uſing the ſame medicine ſhows that it has not fully cured the wound, nor yet perfectly done its work.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The ſacrifice of the Maſs, they ſay, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to apply the vertue and merit of the ſacrifice of the Croſs; for though the ſacrifice of the Croſs like a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werful medicament have ſufficient vertue in it, yet what does that ſignifie unleſs it be applyed to us, which it is by the ſacrifice of the Maſs? But is there not another way to apply that to us? Is it not appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us by Faith, and by the common means of Chriſts own inſtitution, the Chriſtian Sacraments, and eſpecially by the Worthy Receiving of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, wherein as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt, and the bread which we break, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the body of Christ,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. We do hereby communicate and are made partakers of Chriſts Body as it was ſacrificed for us, that is, of all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and benefits of his ſacrifice by being as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle adds, verſe 17. <hi>Made partakers of that One bread,</hi> that is ſurely by eating it ſacramentally and religiouſly as Chriſt has appointed; for it would ſound very hard and be a very odd expreſſion, to ſay we are partakers of that one bread by the ſacrificing or offering up of that bread, when they will not own that the bread is ſacrificed, or if it were, could we well be thereby partakers of it, but 'tis the eating of that bread which makes us partakers of it; and 'tis the eating Chriſts Body, and drinking his Blood in the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that communicates and applies the vertue of his
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36224:130"/>ſacrifice of the Croſs to us, and not the ſacrificing of that again, as the Apoſtle goes on verſe 18. <hi>Are not they who eat of the ſacrifices, partakers of the Altar?</hi> 'tis eating and communicating, that makes us parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Chriſts ſacrifice. We do then eat of the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſo partake of it as the Jews did of their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; the communion is a feaſting upon a true <hi>oblatum,</hi> the body and blood of Chriſt, as is excellently made out by a Learned man of our own, we do not there ſacrifice Chriſts body, but only ſacramentally eat of it, as being already ſacrificed and offered once for all, by Chriſt himſelf upon the Croſs. It is not at all neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that it ſhould be ſacrificed again <hi>by</hi> us to make us become partakers of it; for cannot a ſacrifice be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed without being ſacrificed again? It ſeems a very ſtrange and uncouth way to ſacrifice the ſame thing over and over in order to applying the vertue of it, as if the Jews when they had ſlain the Paſchal Lamb, muſt have ſlain another Lamb in order to the partak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vertue of it, no they were to eat of it for that purpoſe, and ſo are we of Chriſts ſacrifice, and this is the way whereby we do communicate of it, and have its full vertue applyed to us. It was the weakneſs and inſufficiency of their ſacrifices that made them ſo often repeat them, and ſacrifice them anew, but Chriſts ſacrifice being perfect is to be but once offered, though it be often to be eaten and partaken of by us, which it may be without being again ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Authour of this Epiſtle makes not the leaſt mention of Chriſts ſacrifice being offered again upon Earth, or of its being repeated in the ſacrifice of the Maſs, but after he himſelf had once offered it upon the Croſs, he immediately ſpeaks of his preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to God in Heaven, and there by vertue of it <pb n="38" facs="tcp:36224:131"/>interceeding and mediating with him for us, <hi>that by his own blood he entered into the holy place, having ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained eternal Redemption for us, chap.</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. as the Jewiſh high prieſt on the great day of expiation after he had offered the ſacrifice of atonement for the whole Congregation upon the Altar, carried the blood of it into the Holy of Holies, and there ſprinkled it before the mercy-ſeat, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.15. This great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary ſacrifice for the whole Congregation was the great Type and Figure of Chriſts ſacrifice for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the Holy of Holies was the Type of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the High Prieſt, of Chriſt, as is confeſſed by all; Chriſt therefore our great High Prieſt to whom alone it belonged to offer this ſacrifice of Atonement and Expiation for the whole World, having done this upon the Croſs <hi>he entred not into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true, but into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us, chap,</hi> 9. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. To appear there as our Advocate and Mediator, and by vertue of his own blood there preſented to his Father to make a very powerful inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us. Now from this diſcourſe of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle we have a full account of Chriſts ſacrifice that it was to be once offered upon the croſs, and then to be carried into the Holy of Holies in Heaven, and no more to be offered upon Earth, <hi>for this man after he had offered one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God,</hi> chap. 10. ver. 12. The Apoſtle ſpeaks not one tittle, nor gives the leaſt hint or intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſacrifice being offered again by others up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, this lyes croſs to the whole tenour of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the ſimilitude and agreement which he repreſents between the Jewiſh ſacrifice of Atonement, and Chriſts is quite altered and deſtroyed by it, for beſides the High Prieſts offering this ſacrifice, this makes every leſſer Prieſt to be ſtill offering the ſame ſacrifice <pb n="39" facs="tcp:36224:131"/>upon the Altar, when the High Prieſt is entred with the blood of it into the Holy of Holies; and though he cannot go in there, upon which the vertue and the perfection of the ſacrifice does in great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, yet ſtill to offer the ſame ſacrifice; and beſides it makes this ſacrifice like to the Jewiſh, <hi>where every prieſt ſtandeth daily miniſtring and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices, which</hi> for the reaſon ſhewed, they <hi>could never take away ſins, chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to which he ſays, <hi>this man after he had offered, one ſacrifice for ſins, for ever ſat down on the right hand of God, verſe</hi> 13. that is, Chriſts ſacrifice was never to be repeated as the Jewiſh were; for if it had been to be offered by others though not by Chriſt himſelf, and the Chriſtian Prieſts were to ſtand daily miniſtring and offering the ſame ſacrifice, both they and their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice would have been the ſame upon this account with the Jewiſh, and there had not been that difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, which the Apoſtle does there plainly mean and declare.</p>
                  <p>Further it cannot but ſeem very ſtrange that when this Divine Author does ſo largely and copiouſly and deſignedly treat of the ſacrifice of Chriſt and of thoſe of the Jews, and compare them ſo much together, and ſhow the excellency of the one above the other, that he ſhould never ſay the leaſt word of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, when he had ſo much occaſion to do it, that it can hardly be imagined he ſhould have ſo wholly omitted it, had it been as others ſince account it, as true and proper a ſacrifice as any of the Jewiſh or of Chriſts himſelf upon the croſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The Apoſtle here plainly layes down a principle directly contrary and wholly inconſiſtent with their Doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and that is, that if Chriſt be offered he muſt ſuffer and that <pb n="40" facs="tcp:36224:132"/>without ſhedding of blood there is no Remiſſion. Nor yet ſaith he at the 25, 26. verſes, and 9th. chapter,
<hi>That he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the high priest entereth into the holy place every year with the blood of others. For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world, but now once in the end of the world hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi> For then muſt he often have ſuffered if he had been often offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without ſuffering then Chriſt cannot be offered and ſacrificed, and indeed to ſacrifice any thing is to conſume and deſtroy it, ſo that it be wholly parted with and given up to God, and to ſacrifice any thing that is living, is to take away its life and to kill it, and ſo to make it ſuffer death, as a vicarious puniſhment in anothers ſtead; this is the common and allowed noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſacrifices, but Chriſt cannot thus ſuffer in the Maſs, therefore he cannot be truly offered or ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, ſince according to the Apoſtle if he be often offered he muſt often ſuffer; and they would not I hope crucifie to themſelves the Lord of Life again, and put him to death upon the Altar as the Jews did upon the croſs, and yet without this they cannot truly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice him, or properly offer him according to the Apoſtle. But this ſays their great Champion the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> is done myſtically, <hi>Chriſt is myſtically ſlain, and doth myſtically ſuffer death upon the Altar,</hi> that is, by way of repreſentation and reſemblance, and the myſterious ſignification of what is done there, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the <hi>Galatians, chap.</hi> 3. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>Before whoſe eyes Jeſus Chriſt hath been evidently ſet forth crucified among you.</hi> Now ſo Chriſt may be crucified every time we hear or read his crucifixion lively repreſented to us, as we may ſee a bloody Tragedy without one drop of blood ſpilt, ſo Chriſt may be myſtically ſlain in the Sacrament when his body is broke, and his blood poured out in myſtery and repreſentation, but this is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36224:132"/>not true and proper Offering which is neceſſary to make a true and proper ſacrifice as they will have that of the Maſs to be; if they would be contented with a myſtical ſacrifice to repreſent and commemorate Chriſts death, that they know we are willing to allow, and then a myſtical ſuffering that is not a real and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, would be ſufficient for a myſtical that is not proper ſacrifice, but the ſuffering muſt be as true and proper as the ſacrifice, and if the one be but myſtical, the other muſt be ſo too; if the Bullock or Goat of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering which was to be offered on the great day of Atonement had been only Myſtically ſlain, and Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally offered upon the Altar, they had been as really alive for all that as any that were in the Fields, and had been no more true and proper ſacrifices of atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and expiation then <hi>they</hi> were,
<hi>for without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of blood,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>there is no Remiſſion, Heb.</hi> 9.22. it was the ſhedding or pouring out the blood in which the Life was ſuppoſed to be, and therefore the taking away the Life of the ſacrifice that did really make the ſacrifice to be truly propitiatory or available before God, as a price and recompence for the remiſſion of ſins; and how then can the ſacrifice of the Maſs be truly propitiatory, when the blood is not truly ſhed, when according to themſelves it is <hi>Incruentum ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium,</hi> an unbloody ſacrifice, and therefore according to the Apoſtle it cannot be pro pitiatory for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, as will be further inſiſted upon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Thus we ſee how much there is in thoſe clear places of Scripture againſt the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and how little there is for it in thoſe dark ones, which are produced by our Adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It has no juſt claim to Antiquity nor was there any ſuch Doctrine or Practice in the Primitive Church; this is greatly boaſted and vaunted of, and <pb n="42" facs="tcp:36224:133"/>although their cauſe runs very low in Scripture, yet they pretend it carries all Antiquity before it, where nothing is more common than to have the name of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and Sacrifice, and Hoſt, and Victim attributed to the bleſſed Euchariſt, and to have it ſaid that we do there offer, and immolate and ſacrifice unto God; this we readily acknowledge, and though we can by no means allow Antiquity to take place of Scripture, or to ſet up either an Article of Faith, or eſſential part of Worſhip which is not in Scripture, and our Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries ſeem to agree with us in this, that there muſt be a divine Inſtitution for a ſacrifice, or elſe it can have no true foundation; ſo that if Scripture fails them, 'tis in vain to flye for refuge to Antiquity, yet we doubt not but that Scripture and Antiquity will be fairly recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled and be made very good Friends in this point; and both of them againſt the ſacrifice of the Maſs, as 'tis taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The name of Sacrifice and oblation is often given both in Scripture and Antiquity, in an improper gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and metaphorical ſenſe, thus it is applyed to the inward actions of the mind, to penitence and ſorrow for ſin, <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God thou wilt not deſpiſe, Pſal.</hi> 51.17.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36224:142"/>of it, for when it began to be believed that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was a true ſacrifice that was beneficial and of extraordinary vertue meerly as it was offered to God without being received by themſelves, then the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple left off frequent communicating according to the Primitive cuſtom in which there is no ſuch thing to be found as is now introduced into the Church by this new Doctrine, namely, the Prieſts communicating alone without the people, and celebrating Maſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Communion of others.

St. <hi>Denys</hi> called the <hi>Areopagite</hi> ſpeaks <hi>of the Prieſts exhorting others at the Cûmmunion, and praying that they who partake of theſe Myſteries, may partake of them wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily.</hi> The ſame is in all the Lyturgies which go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of St. <hi>James,</hi> St.
<hi>Mark,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> in which there are the diſtinct parts of the people, as well as of the Prieſt, as when the Prieſt is to ſay
<hi>peace be with you all,</hi> the people are to anſwer, <hi>and with thy ſpirit,</hi> and the ſervice is ſo framed as to ſuppoſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire company in Communicating, or elſe it would be nonſenſical and ridiculous for the Prieſt alone to pray to God <hi>to breathe upon us his ſervants that are preſent, to grant that the Sacraments may be to all us that partake of them, the Communion of the bleſſedneſs of eternal Life;</hi> and after the Communion is over, <hi>after all have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,</hi> for the prieſt to give the bleſſing to all, and pray, <hi>God to bleſs and protect us all who were partakers <pb n="63" facs="tcp:36224:143"/>of the Mysteries;</hi> The ſame form of ſpeaking in the plural is in the more Authentick Liturgies of St.
<hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> where it is very odd for the Prieſt to exhort others to pray, to give thanks and the like, and to pray God that <hi>they may be worthy partakers of the Sacrament,</hi> if none were to partake of it but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Roman Miſſal which is much older then theſe private Maſſes, or then the Doctrine of the Maſs, as I ſhall preſently ſhow, ſpeaks after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and makes the Prieſt pray <hi>for all that are preſent, and that all who have communicated may be filled with all heavenly benediction and Grace.</hi> Theſe muſt be all very improper for the Prieſt to ſay when he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates by himſelf, and he may with as good reaſon make a Congregation by himſelf alone, as make a Communion. Private Maſſes then which ſprang up from the ſacrifice of the Maſs, and are wholly ſuited and agreeable to that Doctrine, theſe being ſo contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the beſt Antiquity, ſhow that that Doctrine alſo on which they are founded, and from whence they aroſe is ſo too. And I have the more largely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered theſe becauſe they are another great corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Euchariſt of the Roman Church, tho they are originally derived from the ſacrifice of the Maſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The very Canon of the Maſs, as 'tis at preſent in the Roman Church, has very little in it agreeable to this new Doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, but though it is ſomewhat difficult to give a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain account of the time of its compoſition, it being made at firſt by an unknown Author, whom St. <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> calls <hi>Scholaſticus,</hi> who is ſuppoſed by ſome to be Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> though had St.

Now this is the ſtrangeſt ſacrifice that ever was in the World, a viſible oblation of an inviſible thing; had the Jews offered their ſacrifices in this manner, they had offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing at all, and had Chriſt thus offered himſelf to God upon the croſs only in phantaſm and appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance as ſome Hereticks would have had him, and not in the viſible ſubſtance of his body, it would have been only a phantaſtick ſacrifice, and we had been redeemed by a ſhadow.

The Conſumption then by eating belongs to it not as a ſacrifice but a Sacrament, and the body of Chriſt is not then conſumed but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpecies, nay the body of Chriſt is not then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed under the ſpecies, for the real conſumption be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to the ſpecies and not to the body of Chriſt, which is no more truly conſumed with them, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, then it is as ſitting in heaven, no more then a mans fleſh is conſumed when only his clothes or his mantle is tore tho he were in them. <hi>What though it ceaſes to be really on the Altar, and ceaſes to be a ſenſible food,</hi> as he farther explains, or rather intangles it; Is Chriſts body ever a ſenſible food? And is its ceaſing to be upon the Altar, a conſumption of it? Then <hi>Iſaac</hi> was conſumed when he was took off from the Altar on which <hi>Abraham</hi> had laid him, and if his Father had been as ſubtle as our Roman Sophiſters and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, he might only have covered him with the skin of the Ram, and have conſumed that as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſpecies by fire, and ſo
<hi>Iſaac</hi> had been both ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, and conſumed, and deſtroyed too, and yet have been as live as ever for all this. Such abſurdities do they run into when they will make their notion ſuit of a true ſacrifice and that which is not one, and a man of ſenſe muſt yet deſtroy his ſenſe one would think before he can talk at this rate.</p>

The Fraction of the Elements after they are conſecrated which is done by the Prieſt, not for diſtribution, for they give them whole to the people, but for another myſtical reaſon, this is not the formal Eſſence of the ſacrifice, for Chriſt they own did not break them in this manner at his laſt Supper, when yet they will have him ſacrifice, and this is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times omitted by themſelves; neither is manducation,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36224:149"/>for this is performed by the people as well as the prieſt when they communicate, and ſacrificing does not then belong to them, nor is it ever their work but only the Prieſts, and yet they then eat and conſume the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as the prieſt, ſo that ſacrificing cannot properly lye in this, neither can it be proved that Chriſt did himſelf eat when he is ſuppoſed to ſacrifice; and beſides both this fraction and manducation belongs only to the ſpecies, they are the only proper ſubject of thoſe actions, but it is the Body and Blood of Chriſt that is ſacrificed and not the ſpecies. For this reaſon therefore conſecration it ſelf cannot well paſs for the formal act of ſacrificing, for 'tis the Bread is conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not Chriſts body: 'tis the bread only is changed by conſecration, that is ſuppoſed indeed to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it is conſecrated, and if this be ſacrificing it is ſacrificing of nothing, or at moſt 'tis but ſacrificing of bread which is a meaner ſacrifice then many of the Jewiſh, neither is this change of it viſible and external, but they will needs have the ſacrificing action to be ſenſible and external or elſe the ſacrifice will not be ſo, and if it be only a ſpiritual and internal and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal offering up of Chriſts body and blood to God this is not proper ſacrificing of it again, but only by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Faith and Devotion which we are very willing to allow. But conſecration muſt ſet Chriſts body up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Altar and put it into the hands of the prieſt and then it muſt be viſibly offered to God, and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conſumed, and this is the true way of ſacrificing it, for
<hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes in conſumption as neceſſary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with conſecration; the oblation he owns is not verbal, neither did Chriſt thus offer his Body and Blood at his laſt Supper but after he had bleſſed and brake the bread he gave it to his Diſciples, but placing this upon the Altar by the words of conſecration is a real Oblation of it, and then eating and conſuming it <pb n="75" facs="tcp:36224:149"/>there formally conſtitutes the ſacrifice. The Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> in his Expoſition ſeems to make the whole Eſſence of the ſacrifice conſiſt in Conſecration alone without any manducation or deſtruction, which <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> makes abſolutely neceſſary; <hi>Chriſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is placed upon the holy Table, clothed with thoſe ſigns that repreſent his death in vertue of the words of conſecration which are the ſpiritual ſword that make a mystical ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration betwixt the Body and the Blood.</hi> Now if Chriſt be thus only ſacrificed myſtically and by repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he is not ſacrificed truly and properly, nor is there any true and proper propitiation made hereby, which is the true ſtate of the Controverſie between us; Chriſt may be ſacrificed repreſentatively, as
<hi>Caeſar</hi> may be ſlain in a Tragedy, without being really preſent, and if he were preſent and placed upon the Altar, as they will needs have him, yet he is no more ſacrificed by the myſtical repreſentation then if
<hi>Caeſars</hi> Picture were ſtab'd and he were behind it unhurt. I ſee no reaſon why Chriſts preſence ſhould be neceſſary to make ſuch a myſtical repreſentative, or commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſacrifice, and if Chriſt were preſent I ſee not how he is more ſacrificed then if he were abſent. So that they only confound their thoughts to make a proper ſacrifice where there is none, and when they have boaſted of a true proper viſible external ſacrifice, they know not where to find any ſuch thing, and it comes to no more at laſt then a meer commemorative and repreſentative one, or in plain words to a ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental and Myſtical repreſentation and remembrance of a paſt ſacrifice, which there is neither any need nor any poſſibility of renewing.</p>
                  <p>Their differences about the proper ſacrificial act whereby they do with good ſucceſs deſtroy one anothers notions of it, and ſo taken together deſtroy the thing it ſelf, theſe are the more conſiderable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <pb n="76" facs="tcp:36224:150" rendition="simple:additions"/>'tis not the <hi>res ſacrificii</hi> which makes the ſacrifice, though that were never ſo truly preſent, but the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing Act, or the Actual ſacrificing it, for as <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> ſays,<note n="*" place="margin">Nam non res illa, ſed rei illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us oblatio proprie eſt ſacrificium, ſacrificium enim eſt a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>A ſacrifice is an action not a permanent thing, and
'tis not the thing it ſelf, but the offering it is properly the ſacrifice.</hi> So that though Chriſts natural Body and Blood were never ſo much preſent in the Euchariſt even according to the Doctrine of Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation it ſelf; yet ſo long as there is no proper acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on there to ſacrifice it, or no ſacrificing act, it would ſignifie nothing to the making it a ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This Doctrine of the Maſs makes a living body a ſacrifice which requires it ſhould be dead, and yet at the ſame repreſents it dead when it ſuppoſes it preſent in a ſtate of life, which is as odd a jumble as making a man to be by at his own funeral, and at the ſame time bringing in the perſon alive, &amp; yet dreſſing up his picture to remember him dead and in the habit of death it ſelf. The Euchariſt is to remember and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Chriſt in a ſtate of death, his body and blood as ſeparated from one another, and the one broken and the other poured out, and the words of conſecration <hi>are the ſpiritual ſword,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> calls them, that are to do this, and ſo to conſtitute the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but whilſt this is a doing, nay by the very doing this thing, the ſame ſpiritual ſword becomes a ſpiritual word, and raiſes the ſame body living, and ſets it in that ſtate upon the Altar, ſo that by this means it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the ſacrifice a great deal more then it made it before, for it makes it be then truly living, whereas it only repreſented it before as dead. So that 'tis at the ſame time a dead repreſentative ſacrifice, and a living proper ſacrifice, which is in truth no ſacrifice at all, for a living ſacrifice is juſt as much ſenſe as a dead Animal, that is, 'tis a contradiction, and one of the
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36224:150"/>Terms deſtroys the other. If a Jewiſh Prieſt had knockt down the Oxe with one hand, and raiſed him up with the other, or reſtored him to life after he had ſlew him, this would have made but a very odde ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; and to make Chriſt dead <hi>by</hi> the ſacramental ſigns, and to ſacrifice him thus in <hi>Effigie,</hi> and to make him alive again <hi>under</hi> the ſacramental ſigns, and ſo to ſacrifice him truly this is a ſtrange and unaccountable riddle. I would ask whether the conſecrated ſpecies of Bread and Wine by <hi>which Chriſts blood is ſhed myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, and death intervenes only by repreſentation,</hi> as the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> phraſes it, whether theſe would make a real ſacrifice without Chriſts living body under them? if not, 'tis not this myſtical repreſentation of death makes the ſacrifice? Or whether Chriſts liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing body without thoſe ſpecies and ſigns of his death would be a ſacrifice? If not then 'tis not the placing that upon the Altar and ſo a real Oblation of it there makes the ſacrifice, and then what is it that does ſo? Is it not very odd that the ſame perſon muſt be there ſeemingly dead, and yet really alive at the ſame time to make up this ſacrifice?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The making it truly propitiatory is a very great Error, and inconſiſtent with it ſelf. All our Religious Duties and all our vertuous actions may in a large and improper ſenſe be ſaid to be propitiatory, as they are ſaid alſo in Scripture to be ſacrifices, for no doubt but they make God kind and propitious to us, and incline him to have Mercy upon us; and the bleſſed Euchariſt as it exhibits to us all the graces and benefits which Chriſt hath by his death purchaſed for us, whereof Pardon and Remiſſion of fin which is hereby ſealed to us, is a very great one, ſo far may be called propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory, and it may be inſtituted for the Remiſſion of ſin, ſo far as it is to apply to us the vertue of Chriſts <pb n="78" facs="tcp:36224:151"/>body and blood and make us partakers of his ſacrifice upon the Croſs, but this it may do as it is a Sacrament without being any ſacrifice, much leſs without being a propitiatory one as the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined it, to be

Thus truth will out at laſt, though there be never ſo much art uſed to ſtifle and conceal it, and this is very fairly to give up the queſtion, and ſurrender the cauſe; for he owns it is not properly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory and gives a very good reaſon for it, becauſe Chriſt in his immortal ſtate cannot merit or ſatisfie or be a true propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation for us; the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux</hi> was aware of this and therefore he makes Chriſts preſence upon the Altar to be not a propitiation, but <hi>a powerful Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before God for all mankind, according to the ſaying of the Apoſtle that Jeſus Chriſt preſents himſelf, and appears for us before the face of God,</hi> Heb. 9.24. <hi>So that Chriſt being preſent upon the holy Table under this figure of death, intercedes for us, and repreſents continually to his Father that death which he has ſuffered for his Church</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Expoſition of the Doctrine of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church.</note>. But how comes this Interceſſion of Chriſt to be upon Earth? Is it not to be in heaven, and is not Chriſt there to appear in the preſence of God for us? Is not Chriſt entered into the heavens for that purpoſe as the High Prieſt went into the Holy of Holies with the blood of the great ſacrifice of Atonement after that was offered upon the Altar? Does not the Apoſtle thus repreſent it in that place in alluſion, and with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that Jewiſh Oeconomy, and could any but Monſieur <hi>de Meaux</hi> have brought that place to ſhow that Chriſt intercedes for us by being preſent upon the Altar, when the Apoſtles diſcourſe is as directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that as can be, and makes him to appear only in Heaven, or in the preſence of God for us, and there preſent himſelf and his ſacrifice to God, as the Jewiſh High Prieſt carried the blood of the Anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſacrifice of Expiation into the Holy of Holies, and there ſprinkled it before the Mercy-ſeat.
<hi>Chriſt is not <pb n="80" facs="tcp:36224:152"/>entred into the holy place made with hands which are the figures of the true, but into Heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> Chriſt therefore making Interceſſion for us only in heaven and propitiation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the Croſs, how the ſacrifice of the Maſs ſhould be either Interceſſory, which is a new way of <hi>de Meaux</hi>'s or propitiatory as the Council of

Some of them tell us it is propitiatory only relatively, and by appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as it relates and applyes to us the propitiatory vertue of the ſacrifice of the Croſs, but this it may do as a Sacrament, and then it is not propitiatory in it ſelf,

The Euchariſt we all ſay doth apply to us the ſacrifice of the Croſs, or the benefits of Chriſts death as it is a Sacrament, but it is not therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory <pb n="83" facs="tcp:36224:153"/>as it is ſuch, nor is it any way neceſſary it ſhould, and as a ſacrifice it cannot be applicatory, for it muſt be offered to God, and therefore as ſuch it could not apply any thing to us, for our giving it up or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing it to God is quite another thing and very different from Gods giving or applying it to us. God gives Chriſts body and blood to us in the Euchariſt as it is a Sacrament, but as it is a ſacrifice we muſt give it to him, and that would be as ſtrange a way of applying it to our ſelves, as a Patients returning his Phyſick or making a preſent of it to the Doctor, would be a new and ſtrange method of taking it himſelf. And that the Prieſts intention ſhould apply this is ſtill as ſtrange, for the Prieſts intention in the Maſs is to conſecrate and ſo to ſacrifice, and that is giving the thing to God and not applying it to others; if he gives them the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament indeed to eat then he applyes the ſacrifice of Chriſts body and blood to them; but how he can do this when he does not give it them but only give it to God, that is, ſacrifice it, I do not underſtand: The Jews had the vertue of their ſacrifices applyed to them by eating of them, or by having the blood ſprinkled upon them or by ſome ſuch Ceremony to make them partakers of them, but that another ſacrifice was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or the ſame ſacrifice reiterated in order to apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them is a thing unknown and unheard of Chriſts ſacrifice is applyed to us by the ſacrament of Baptiſm and therefore that alſo is called a ſacrifice as it both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents Chriſts death, and confers to us the benefits of it, thus

The Offering this Sacrifice to redeem ſouls out of Purgatory, as it is made one of the greateſt ends and uſes of this Sacrifice of the Maſs, ſo is one of the greateſt Errors and Abuſes that belong to it, for beſides that it contains in it all the foregoing Errors and Abſurdities of its being a proper Sacrifice, and ſo bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting thoſe who do not at all receive it as a Sacrament, and being properly propitiatory at leaſt for leſſer ſins, and for the temporal pains that they ſuppoſe due to <pb n="89" facs="tcp:36224:156"/>greater ſins after they are forgiven, which is another cluſter of Errors that grows likewiſe to this Doctrine, though it belongs to another place to conſider them. I ſay beſides all thoſe Errors it takes in alſo the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and uncomfortable and erronious opinion of Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, whereby a great many departed Souls are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be in a ſad ſtate of extream pain and torment till they are delivered from it by theſe Maſſes and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices which are offered for them to that purpoſe. And this is indeed the great advantage of them, I mean to the Prieſts that offer them, who hereby make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize not only of the Souls of Men, but of Chriſts Body and Blood, and are made by this ſacrifice a ſort of Mony-changers in the Temple, and inſtead of Doves ſell Chriſt himſelf, and the ſouls in Purgatory are redeemed out of it by ſuch corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, which are to purchaſe Maſſes, that is, Chriſts body and bloud at a certain price. This is a moſt horrible abuſe of Chriſtianity, which expoſes it to infinite ſcandal and reproach, the ſelling of Maſſes and Indulgences is ſo viſible a blot in Popery that though nothing has more enriched, yet nothing has more ſhamed it then theſe have done; both thoſe have relation to Purgatory which is an unknown Countrey in the other World, that hath given riſe to thoſe two profitable Trades and to all that ſpiritual Traffic that is carried on by it. A Late excellent diſcourſe has ſo fully conſidered that ſubject, that I am no further to meddle with it here then as the ſacrifice of the Maſs is concerned in it. Our Adverſaries moſt plauſible and ſpecious pretence for both thoſe Doctrines is taken from the antient cuſtom of oblations for the Dead, which cannot be denyed to be of great antiquity and general uſe even very near the beginnings of Chriſtianity, and to have had a long continuance in the Chriſtian Church. <hi>Tertullian</hi> mentions them <hi>as

I anſwer that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of thoſe Opinions as they are now held, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do follow from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Cuſtom of offering for the Dead, but that they were of another nature then what they account them, and this I ſhall evince from the following conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then theſe Oblations were made for departed Souls who were not ſuppoſed to be in a ſtate of pain, as they now believe Purgatory to be, but in a ſtate of eaſe and happineſs, as St.
<hi>Auſtin</hi> believed his Mother to be when he offered for her, and when he prayed for her,<note n="*" place="margin">&amp; credo qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>he did believe that God had already granted her what he prayed for, but he beg'd him to accept theſe free Will offerings of his mouth.</hi> It was not then a doubt of her ſtate but only the voluntary expreſſions of his Love and Duty which he deſigned by his Prayers and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for her, and thoſe Olations were made even for Saints and Martyrs, and the moſt holy Chriſtians of whoſe future happineſs there was no manner of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, and for all indeed who dyed in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church. And therefore</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They were an honorary Teſtimony given to them of their good ſtate, and of their dying in the Peace and Communion of the Church: to have their names recited at the Altar ſervice out of the Diptychs or folded Tables was an honorary memorial and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them as members of the Church, and 'twas a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning them as ſuch to expunge, or blot their names out of thoſe Diptychs; and ſo the making or receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oblations for them at the Altar, was an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of their right to the Altar, &amp; to the Chriſtian Communion, and therefore no oblations were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36224:158"/>and not by any vertue in theſe oblations as they were a ſacrifice, diſtinct from the benefit of the Prayers; as they were Alms indeed together with prayers they thought the dead benefitted by them together with the prayers, and ſo St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the fore-quoted place mentions the ſacrifices of the Altar which he explains by prayers and Alms, both which he calls ſacrifices<note n="*" place="margin">ſive altaris, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve orationum, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve eleemoſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum ſacrificiis ſupplicamus. <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
                     </note>, but not in a proper and ſtrict ſenſe as our Adverſaries muſt acknowledge. For theſe ſacrifices I hope were not true and proper ones ſuch as the ſacrifice of the Maſs is held to be, nor were they properly propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory for their ſins, nor did the Antients who prayed for the dead at the Altar and made oblations for them, think that theſe oblations were properly propitiatory, or ſatisfactory for their ſins, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believes the ſacrifice of Maſs now to be: there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that amounts to this in any of thoſe places where they ſpeak of offerings for the dead, nor would St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> or the Biſhops who ordained in Council that no offerings ſhould be made for him who appointed a Clergy-Man Executor to his Will, have inflicted ſo ſevere a puniſhment upon ſo ſmall a fault, had they thought this would have deprived his ſoul of a true and real propitiation for his ſins, nor would blotting out of the Diptychs have been ſo commonly put in uſe, had this been conſigning the ſoul to the puniſhments of another World.</p>
                  <p>There was therefore no ſuch thing meant as our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries would now draw from that ancient cuſtom of Oblations for the Dead; and yet that this quickly degenerated into ſuperſtition and has been farther im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in aftertimes and is now come to very great perfection in the Roman Church we willingly own; &amp; that the firſt beginnings of this were lay'd in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptural cuſtom, as the Worſhip of Saints was from the Anniverſary memory of the Martyrs is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed: <pb n="94" facs="tcp:36224:159"/>But corruptions in Religion like Diſeaſes in the body might proceed at firſt from very ſmall cauſes, but by neglect and careleſsneſs grow oftentimes very great and dangerous, eſpecially when the Phyſicians that ſhould have cured them, thought it for their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and intereſt rather to heighten and increaſe them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The ſacrifice of the Maſs muſt either be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, or elſe muſt reflect on the ſacrifice of the Croſs, if it be not neceſſary for obtaining the pardon and remiſſion of any ſin, or for the relief of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual want and neceſſity for which there has been no proviſion made by the ſacrifice of the croſs, then it is wholly uſeleſs &amp; unprofitable; if it be neceſſary for any ſuch purpoſe then the ſacrifice of the croſs is not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and ſufficient for all thoſe ends, but requires this ſacrifice of the Maſs to make up what is lacking, and behind of the ſufferings of Chriſt upon the croſs, which is a great diminution to the infinite value of them. It is impoſſible to avoid theſe inconveniences, for if the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the croſs be ſo great as to expiate all manner of ſin, and to take away all kinds of puniſhment that are due to it, and to ſupply all the ſpiritual wants and neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties whatever of all Chriſtians, then what poſſible need can there be of any other ſacrifice? And if Chriſts ſacrifice once offered upon the croſs can do all this, why ſhould there be any new offering or any reiteration of the ſame ſacrifice, when by being once offered it hath done the whole buſineſs that it can do were it offered never ſo often: but if there be any kinds of ſins, which becauſe they are dayly commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us therefore require a dayly ſacrifice, as they pretend, to be offered for them, which implyes that the conſtant and abiding vertue of the croſs cannot reach them, which is yet as efficacious to all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36224:159"/>now as the firſt day it was offered, or as it could be if it were offered every day by Chriſt himſelf; or if there be any ſuch temporal remains of puniſhment after the eternal guilt of them is pardoned, which are not diſcharged by Chriſts ſacrifice upon the Croſs, but there is this ſmall hand-Writing ſtill however againſt us and continues uncancelled notwithſtanding the Death of Chriſt, then we are not perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from all puniſhment, and from the whole Curſe of the Law by the ſacrifice of the croſs, but there is ſomething more neceſſary to deliver and ſave us if not from Hell yet from Purgatory, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Chriſt has done for us yet the Maſs ſacrifice muſt ſtill help us, not as an inſtrument of Religion to work upon us and make us better, but as a ſacrifice to God to prevail with him to free us from puniſhment, or elſe we are in a miſerable condition, which is the true contrivance of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily renders it very injurious to the moſt perfect and ſufficient ſacrifice of the croſs.</p>
                  <p>I might add many other Errors belonging to this Doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, ſuch as ſaying their Maſſes in an unknown Tongue, putting confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the meer <hi>opus operatum,</hi> offering up Maſſes to the honour of the Saints, and the like, but thoſe do more properly fall under other heads of controverſie, and are the peculiar ſubjects of other Treatiſes that are written on purpoſe upon thoſe matters; for though theſe all run into this Doctrine of the ſacrifice of the Maſs, which is the great Lake into which moſt of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Errors empty themſelves, yet the firſt head and riſe of them is not from hence, and ſo I ſhall not take them in here.</p>
                  <p>The Maſs ſacrifice contains in it a whole Legion of Errors, but 'tis only the principal one which I have endeavoured by this Diſcourſe to caſt out, and that <pb n="96" facs="tcp:36224:160"/>is its being a proper and truly propitiatory ſacrifice, which I have ſhown <hi>to be founded upon two monſtrous Errours, to have no true foundation in Scripture, nor no juſt claim to Antiquity, but to be plainly contrary to both thoſe, and to be in it ſelf very abſurd and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonable,</hi> which is enough in conſcience againſt any one Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or any Church that maintains it, however In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible they may both of them pretend to be, if this be clearly and ſtrongly made out againſt them, as has been Attempted in this Treatiſe.</p>
